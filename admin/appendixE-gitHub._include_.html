  <p>We use various tools to analyze your code. <mark>For us to be able to identify your commits, you should use the GitHub username as your Git username as well. If there is a mismatch, or if you use multiple user names for Git,</mark> our tools might miss
    some of your work and as a result you might not get credit for some of your work.</p>
  <p>In each Computer you use for coding, after installing Git, you should set the Git username as follows.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open a command window that can run Git commands (e.g., Git bash window)</li>
    <li>Run the command <code>git config --global user.name YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME</code><br> e.g., <code>git config --global user.name JohnDoe</code></li>

  <h2 id="project-schedule-tracking">Project Schedule Tracking</h2>
  <p>In general, use the issue tracker (Milestones, Issues, PRs, Tags, Releases, and Labels) for assigning, scheduling, and tracking <em>all</em> noteworthy project tasks, including user stories. Update the issue tracker regularly to reflect the current
    status of the project. You can also use GitHub's new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6MGKHkNtxU">Projects feature</a> to manage the project, but keep it linked to the issue tracker as much as you can.</p>
  <h3 id="using-issues">Using Issues:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Record each of the user stories you plan to deliver as an issue in the issue tracker.</strong>
        <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span> <code>Title: As a user I can add a deadline</code><br>
        <code>Description: ... so that I can keep track of my deadlines</code></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Assign the <code>type.*</code> and <code>priority.*</code> labels to those issues.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>When you start implementing a story, break it down to tasks.</strong> Define reasonable sized, standalone tasks. A task should be able to done by one person, in a few hours. <span class="dimmed">e.g.</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="dimmed">👍 Good: Update class diagram in the project manual for v1.5</span></li>
        <li><span class="dimmed">👎 Bad (reasons: not a one-person task, not small enough): Write the project manual</span></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Write a descriptive title for the issue.</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g. Add support for the 'undo' command to the parser.</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>There is no need to break things into VERY small tasks.</strong> Keep them as big as possible, but they should be no bigger than what you are going to assign a single person to do within a week. <span class="dimmed">eg.,</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>Implementing parser</code>  <span class="dimmed">: too big because it cannot be done by a single person in a week.</span></li>
        <li><code>Implementing parser support for adding of floating tasks</code> <span class="dimmed">: appropriate size.</span></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Do not track things taken for granted.</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g., <code>push code to repo</code> should not be a task to track. In the example given under the previous point, it is taken for granted that the owner will also (a) test the code and (b) push to the repo when it is ready. Those two need not be tracked as separate tasks.</span></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Omit redundant details.</strong> In some cases, the summary/title is enough to describe the task. In that case, no need to repeat it in the description. There is no need for well-crafted and detailed descriptions for tasks. A minimal description
        is enough. Similarly, labels such as <code>priority</code> can be omitted if you think they don't help you.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Assign tasks to team members using the <code>assignees</code> field.</strong> At any point, there should be some ongoing tasks and some pending tasks against each team member.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Optionally, you can use <code>status.ongoing</code> label to indicate issues currently ongoing.</strong></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <div id="using-milestones">
    <h3 id="using-milestones">Using Milestones:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Use <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-milestones/">GitHub milestones</a> to indicate which issues are to be handled for which milestone by assigning issues to suitable milestones.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Set the deadlines for milestones (in GitHub). Your internal milestones can be set earlier than the deadlines we have set, to give you a buffer.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Note that you can change the milestone plan along the way as necessary.</p>

    <p><strong>Wrapping up a Milestone</strong>:<br>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A working product tagged with the correct tag (e.g. v1.2) is pushed to the main repo.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>All tests passing on Travis for the version tagged above.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Milestone updated to match the product i.e. all issues completed and PRs merged for the milestone should be assigned to the milestone.<br>

        <p>Optionally, issues for the next milestone are assigned to team members (this is not compulsory to do <em>before</em> the tutorial, but we recommend you to do it soon after the tutorial).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Optionally, future milestones are revised based on what you experienced in the current milestone <span class="dimmed"> e.g. if you could not finish all issues assigned to the current milestone, it is a sign that you overestimated how much you can do in a week, which means you might want to reduce the issues assigned to future milestones to match that observation</span>.</p>

        <p>Doing a 'release' on GitHub is optional for v1.1 and v1.2 but compulsory from v1.3.</p>
