      <p>In each Computer you use for coding, after installing Git, you should set the Git username as follows.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open a command window that can run Git commands (e.g., Git bash window)</li>
        <li>Run the command <code>git config --global user.name YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME</code><br> e.g., <code>git config --global user.name JohnDoe</code></li>

      <p>In general, each team is expected to take one of these two directions:</p>
      <p><strong>[Direction 1]  <em>Optimize</em></strong> AddressBook for a more specific target user group:</p>
      <panel header="Examples for the _optimize_ direction" expanded="">
        <p>An AddressBook,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>for users in a specific profession <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. doctors, salesmen, teachers, etc.</span></li>
          <li>based on the nature/scale of contacts <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. huge number of contacts (for HR admins, user group admins), mostly incomplete contacts, highly volatile contact details, contacts become inactive after a specific period (e.g. contract employees)</span></li>
          <li>based on what users do with the contacts <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. organize group events, share info, do business, do analytics</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
      </panel>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>[Direction 2] <em>Morph</em></strong> AddressBook into a different product: Given that AddressBook is a generic app that manages a type of elements (i.e. contacts), you can use it as a starting point to create an app that manages something
        else.<br> ‚ùóÔ∏è This is a high-risk high-reward option because morphing requires extra work but a morphed product may earn more marks than an optimized product of similar complexity.</p>
      <panel header="Examples for _morph_ direction" expanded="">
        <p>An app to manage,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bookmarks of websites</li>
          <li>Tasks/Schedule</li>
          <li>Location info</li>
          <li>Thing to memorize i.e. flash cards, trivia</li>
          <li>Forum posts, news feeds, Social media feeds</li>
          <li>Online projects or issue trackers that the user is interested in</li>
          <li>Emails, possibly from different accounts</li>
          <li>Multiple types of related things <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. Contacts and Tasks (if Tasks are allocated to Contacts)</span></li>
        </ul>
        <p></p>
      </panel>
      <p></p>
      <p>For either direction, you need to define a target user profile and a value proposition:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Target user profile</strong>: Define a very specific target user profile. <br> üí° We required you narrow down the target user profile <span class="dimmed">¬†as opposed to trying to make it as general as possible. Here is an example direction of narrowing down target user: anybody ‚Üí teachers ‚Üí university teachers ‚Üí tech savvy university teachers ‚Üí CS2103 instructors.</span><br>            ‚ùóÔ∏è Be careful not to contradict given project constraints when defining the user profile <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. the target user should still prefer typing over mouse actions</span>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><strong>Value proposition</strong>: Define a clear <em>value proposition</em> <span class="dimmed">¬†what problem does the product solve? how does it make the the user's life easier</span> that matches the target user profile.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>It is expected that your product will be optimized for those specific target users</strong> <span class="dimmed">¬†i.e., add features that are especially/only applicable for target users (to make the app especially attractive to them). To add to the example above, there can be features that are applicable to CS2103 instructors only, such as the ability to navigate to a student's project on GitHub</span><br>        üí° Your project will be graded based on how well the features match the target user profile and how well the features fit-together.</p>
      <panel header="%%Why the need to narrow down the user profile?%%">
        <ul>
          <li>It is an opportunity to exercise your product design skills because optimizing the product to a very specific target user requires good product design skills.</li>
          <li>It minimizes the overlap between features of different teams which can cause plagiarism issues. Furthermore, higher the number of other teams having the same features, less impressive your work becomes especially if others have done a better
            job of implementing that feature.</li>

    <div>
      <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early requirements gathering</strong>.</p>
      <tip-box>
        <p>üí° Here are some tips for using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Define the <em>target user</em>:</strong><br> Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with others?).
            A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even give this user a name. <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. Target user Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</span></li>
          <li><strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong> Decide that exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. Help Jean keep track of all her school contacts</span></li>
          <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br> Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br> For example, consider this user story: <code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br> When
            discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br> When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br> When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation
            details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>
        </ul>
      </tip-box>
    </div>
  </modal>
  <panel header="%%:package: User Story examples (from a different product)%%">
    <p><code>As a user I can add a task by specifying a task description only, so that I can record tasks that need to be done ‚Äòsome day‚Äô.</code><br>
      <code>As a user I can find upcoming tasks, so that I can decide what needs to be done soon.</code><br>
      <code>As a user I can delete a task, so that I can get rid of tasks that I no longer care to track.</code><br>
      <code>As a new user I can view more information about a particular command, so that I can learn how to use various commands.</code><br>
      <code>As an advanced user I can use shorter versions of a command, so that type a command faster.</code></p>

  <h4 id="step-3-prioritize-the-user-stories">Step 3: Prioritize the user stories</h4>
  <img src="/website-base/admin/images/userstories.png" width="250px">
  <p>Suggested workflow:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>Take one user story at a time and get team member opinions about it.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Based on the team consensus, put the story (i.e. the piece of paper) onto one of these three piles:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>Must-Have</code> : The product will be practically useless to the target user without this feature.</li>
        <li><code>Nice-To-Have</code> : The target user can benefit from this user story significantly but you are not certain if you'll have time to implement it.</li>
        <li><code>Not-Useful</code> : No significant benefit to the target user, or does not fit into the product vision.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><span class="dimmed">If using physical paper to record user stories: After all stories have been put in the above three piles, you can make a record of which stories are in the three piles.</span></p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h4 id="step-4-record-v20-requirements-in-the-developer-guide">Step 4: Record v2.0 Requirements in the Developer Guide</h4>
  <p>Based on your user story categorization in step 1, given project requirements, and the current state of the product, select which user stories you are likely to include in v2.0.</p>
  <p>Update the following pages of the Developer Guide:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Target user profile</strong>, <strong>value proposition</strong>, and
      <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v10-userstories"><strong>user stories</strong></trigger>: Update the target user profile and value proposition to match the project direction you have selected. Give a list of the user stories (and update/delete existing ones, if applicable), including priorities.
      This can include user stories considered but will not be included in the final product.</li>
    <li>
      <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v10-usecases"><strong>Use cases</strong></trigger>: Give use cases (textual form) for a few representative user stories that need multiple steps to complete. <span class="dimmed">e.g. Adding a tag to a person (assume the user needs to find the person first)</span></li>
    <li>
      <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v10-nfr"><strong>Non-functional requirements</strong></trigger>:<br> Note: Many of the project constraints mentioned above are NFRs. You can add more. e.g. performance requirements, usability requirements, scalability requirements, etc.</li>
    <li>
      <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v10-glossary"><strong>Glossary</strong></trigger>: Define terms that are worth defining.</li>
    <li>[Optional]
      <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:v10-prodsurveys"><strong>Product survey</strong></trigger>: Explore a few similar/related products and describe your findings i.e. Pros, cons, (from the target user's point of view).</li>

                  <li>Constraints: e.g. the system should be backward compatible with data produced by earlier versions of the system; system testers are available only during the last month of the project; the total project cost should not exceed $1.5 million.</li>
                  <li>Technical requirements: e.g. the system should work on both 32-bit and 64-bit environments.</li>
                  <li>Performance requirements: e.g. the system should respond within two seconds.</li>
                  <li>Quality requirements: e.g. the system should be usable by a novice who has never carried out an online purchase.</li>
                  <li>Process requirements: e.g. the project is expected to adhere to a schedule that delivers a feature set every one month.</li>

            <p>We should spend extra effort in digging NFRs out as early as possible because <strong>NFRs are easier to miss</strong> <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g., stakeholders tend to think of functional requirements first</span> and sometimes <strong>they are critical to the success of the software.</strong>              <span class="dimmed">¬†E.g.

            <p><strong>In the <em>forking workflow</em>, the 'official' version of the software is kept in a remote repo designated as the 'main repo'. All team members fork the main repo create pull requests from their fork to the main repo.</strong></p>
            <p>To illustrate how the workflow goes, let‚Äôs assume Jean wants to fix a bug in the code. Here are the steps:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Jean creates a separate branch in her local repo and fixes the bug in that branch.</li>
              <li>Jean pushes the branch to her fork.</li>

              <li>Other members review Jean‚Äôs pull request.</li>
              <li>If reviewers suggested any changes, Jean updates the PR accordingly.</li>
              <li>When reviewers are satisfied with the PR, one of the members (usually the team lead or a designated 'maintainer' of the main repo) merges the PR, which brings Jean‚Äôs code to the main repo.</li>
              <li>Other members, realizing there is new code in the upstream repo, sync their forks with the new upstream repo (i.e. the main repo). This is done by pulling the new code to their own local repo and pushing the updated code to their own fork.</li>

  <panel type="seamless" header="%%Admin ¬ª Appendix B: Policies ‚Üí Policy on Reuse%%">
    <div>
      <p><strong>Reuse is encouraged. However, note that reuse has its own costs</strong> (such as the learning curve, additional complexity, usage restrictions, and unknown bugs). Furthermore, you will not be given credit for work done by others. Rather,
        you will be given credit for¬†using¬†work done by others.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are allowed to reuse work from your classmates, subject to following conditions:
          <ul>
            <li>The work has been published by us or the authors.</li>
            <li>You clearly give credit to the original author(s).</li>

          <ul>
            <li>The work comes from a source of 'good standing' (such as an established open source project). This means you cannot reuse code written by an outside 'friend'.</li>
            <li>You clearly give credit to the original author. Acknowledge use of third party resources clearly e.g. in the welcome message, splash screen (if any) or under the 'about' menu. If you are open about reuse, you are less likely to get into trouble
              if you unintentionally reused something copyrighted.</li>
            <li>You do not violate the license under which the work has been released. Please¬† <strong>do not use 3rd-party images/audio</strong>¬†in your software unless they have been specifically released to be used freely. Just because you found it in
              the Internet does not mean it is free for reuse.</li>
            <li><mark>Always get permission from us¬†before¬†you reuse</mark>¬†third-party libraries. Please post your 'request to use 3rd party library' in our GitHub forum. That way, the whole class get to see what libraries are being used by others.</li>

          <p>Collate is a tool for collating code written by different developers.</p>
          <p>Steps to use Collate:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Download <code>Collate-TUI.jar</code> from the <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/collate">Collate Tool project</a></li>
            <li>Annotate your code to indicate who wrote which part of the code (instructions given below)</li>
            <li>Run the Collate tool to collate code written by each person into separate files (instructions given below)</li>
          </ol>
          <h4 id="annotating-code-to-indicate-authorship">Annotating code to indicate authorship</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Mark your code with a <code>//@@author {yourGithubUsername}</code>. Note the double <code>@</code>.<br> The <code>//@@author</code> tag should appear only at the beginning of the code you wrote. The code up to the next <code>//@@author</code>                tag or the end of the file (whichever comes first) will be considered as was written by that author. Here is a sample code file:</p>
              <pre class="hljs"><code>//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author sarahkhoo
method 3 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>If you don't know who wrote the code segment below yours</strong>, you may put an empty <code>//@@author</code> (i.e. no GitHub username) to indicate the end of the code segment you wrote. The author of code below yours can add the
                GitHub username to the empty tag later. Here is a sample code with an empty <code>author</code> tag:</p>
              <pre class="hljs"><code>method 0 ...
//@@author johndoe
method 1 ...
method 2 ...
//@@author
method 3 ...
method 4 ...
</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>The author tag syntax varies based on file type</strong> e.g. for java, css, fxml. Use the corresponding comment syntax for non-Java files.<br> Here is an example code from an xml file.</p>
              <pre class="hljs"><code>&lt;!-- @@author sereneWong --&gt;

            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Annotate only significant size code blocks that can be reviewed on its own</strong> <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g., a class, a sequence of methods, a  method.</span> <br> <strong>Claiming credit for code blocks smaller than a method is discouraged</strong>                but allowed.

              <ul>
                <li>If an enhancement required you to do tiny changes in many places, there is no need to collate all those tiny changes; you can describe those changes in the Project Portfolio page instead.</li>
                <li>If a code block was touched by more than one person, either let the person who wrote most of it (e.g. more than 80%) take credit for the entire block, or leave it as 'unclaimed' (i.e., no author tags).</li>
                <li>Related to the above point, <mark>if you claim a code block as your own, more than 80% of the code in that block should have been written by yourself</mark>. For example, no more than 20% of it can be code you reused from somewhere.</li>
                <li>üí° GitHub has a <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/tracing-changes-in-a-file/"><em>blame</em> feature and a <em>history</em></a> feature that can help you determine who wrote a piece of code.</li>

            <li>
              <p><strong>Do not try to boost the length of your collated files using dubious means</strong> such as duplicating the same code in multiple places. In particular, do not copy-paste test cases to create redundant tests. Even repetitive code
                blocks within test methods should be extracted out as utility methods to reduce code duplication.<br> Individual members are responsible for making sure their own collated files contain the correct content.<br> If you notice a team member
                claiming credit for code that he/she did not write or use other questionable tactics, you can email us (after the final submission) to let us know.</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Main things to include:
                  <ul>
                    <li>links to collated code</li>
                    <li>features you implemented <span class="dimmed">¬†(include relevant extracts from the user guide and the developer guide)</span></li>
                    <li>features you propose to implement in future <span class="dimmed">¬†(include relevant extracts from the user guide and the developer guide if applicable)</span><br> Note: the purpose of allowing you to include <em>proposed</em> features
                      is to provide you more flexibility to show your documentation skills. <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. you can bring in a proposed feature just to give you an opportunity to use a UML diagram type not used by the actual features.</span></li>
                    <li>other significant contributions to the project <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. tweaks to existing features, setting up project tools</span></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Other things you can include:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Evidence of helping others <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. responses you posted in our forum, bugs you reported in other team's products</span>,</li>
                    <li>Evidence of technical leadership <span class="dimmed">¬†e.g. offering features for others to reuse, evidence of those features being reused by others</span></li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>If you plan to use the PPP in your Resume, you can also include your SE work outside of the module (will not be graded)</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p><strong>Format</strong>:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Page limit: If you have more content than the limit given below, shorten (or omit some content) so that you do not exceed the page limit. Having too much content in the PPP will be viewed unfavorably during grading. Note: the <mark>page limits given below are <em>after</em> converting to PDF format</mark>.
                  The actual amount of content you require is actually less than what these numbers suggest because the HTML ‚Üí PDF conversion adds a lot of spacing around content.
