**<big>Star rating system</big>**

<div class="indented">

<tip-box> 

TLDR: Start with things that are rated one-star and progress to things with more stars. Things rated four stars are optional.

</tip-box>

* **One-star LOs** {{ one_star }}: The LOs you need to achieve just to keep up with the module. We recommend you to ==achieve these LOs if you want to pass the module== (i.e. up to a **C** grade).
* **Two-stars LOs** {{ two_stars }}: Can get you up to a **B+**.
* **Three-stars LOs** {{ three_stars }}: Can get you up to an **A**.
* **Four-stars LOs** {{ four_stars }}: Can be useful for getting an **A+**, tutors positions, and getting into downstream SE modules that have competitive entry requirements (e.g., CS3281&2, CS3217, CS3216). ==Four-star LOs are not examinable==. Omitting them will not affect your CAP (as A+ has the same CAP as an A grade)

LOs marked with two {{ icon_prereq }} icons e.g., {{ prereq_one_star }},{{ prereq_two_stars }},{{ prereq_three_stars }},{{ prereq_four_stars }} are relevant LOs you are expected have achieved in prerequisite modules. They are given for reference, but are examinable. The number of stars indicate the progression of topics, similar to the star rating system above i.e., one-star prerequisite LOs are the most basic and the most important. four-star pre-requisite LOs can be ignored without affecting CAP.

Note that we use the a similar star rating system to indicate the importance of other info in this website. i.e., information rated as one-star are the most essential. ==Info rated four stars are non-essential and can be ignored== without affecting your ability to follow the module.
