              <p><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a <em>programming paradigm</em>.</strong> A programming paradigm guides programmers to analyze programming problems, and structure programming solutions, in a specific way.</p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>Programming languages have traditionally divided the world into two partsâ€”data and operations on data. Data is static and immutable, except as the operations may change it. The procedures and functions that operate on data have no lasting
                  state of their own; theyâ€™re useful only in their ability to affect data.</p>
                <p>This division is, of course, grounded in the way computers work, so itâ€™s not one that you can easily ignore or push aside. Like the equally pervasive distinctions between matter and energy and between nouns and verbs, it forms the background
                  against which we work. At some point, all programmersâ€”even object-oriented programmersâ€”must lay out the data structures that their programs will use and define the functions that will act on the data.</p>
                <p>With a procedural programming language like C, thatâ€™s about all there is to it. The language may offer various kinds of support for organizing data and functions, but it wonâ€™t divide the world any differently. Functions and data structures
                  are the basic elements of design.</p>
                <p>Object-oriented programming doesnâ€™t so much dispute this view of the world as restructure it at a higher level. It groups operations and data into modular units called objects and lets you combine objects into structured networks to form
                  a complete program. In an object-oriented programming language, objects and object interactions are the basic elements of design.</p>

              <tip-box>
                <p>ðŸ“¦ Java is primarily an OOP language but it supports limited forms of functional programming and it can be used to (although not recommended) write procedural code. <span class="dimmed">Â e.g. <a href="https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level1">se-edu/addressbook-level1</a></span></p>
                <p>ðŸ“¦ JavaScript and Python support functional, procedural, and OOP programming.</p>
