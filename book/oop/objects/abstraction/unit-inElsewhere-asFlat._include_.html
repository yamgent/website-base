      <p>The concept of <strong><em>Objects</em> in OOP is an abstraction mechanism because it allows us to abstract away the lower level details and work with bigger granularity entities</strong> i.e. ignore details data formats and the method implementation
        details and work at the level of objects.</p>
      <tip-box>
        <p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-gift" aria-hidden="true"></span> We can deal with a <code>Person</code> object that represents the person Adam and query the object for Adam's age instead of dealing with details such as Adam’s date of birth (DoB),
          in what format the DoB is stored, the algorithm used to calculate the age from the DoB, etc.</p>
