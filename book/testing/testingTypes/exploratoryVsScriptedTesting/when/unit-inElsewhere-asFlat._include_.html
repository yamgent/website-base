      <p>Which approach is better – <strong>scripted or exploratory? A mix is better.</strong></p>
      <p><strong>The success of exploratory testing depends on the tester’s prior experience and intuition.</strong> Exploratory testing should be done by experienced testers, using a clear strategy/plan/framework. Ad-hoc exploratory testing by unskilled
        or inexperienced testers without a clear strategy is not recommended for real-world non-trivial systems. While <strong>exploratory testing may allow us to detect some problems in a relatively short time, it is not prudent to use exploratory testing as the sole means of testing a critical system</strong>.</p>
      <p><strong>Scripted testing is more systematic, and hence, likely to discover more bugs given sufficient time</strong>, while exploratory testing would aid in quick error discovery, especially if the tester has a lot of experience in testing similar
        systems.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>In some contexts, you will achieve your testing mission better through a more scripted approach; in other contexts, your mission will benefit more from the ability to create and improve tests as you execute them. I find that most situations benefit
          from a mix of scripted and exploratory approaches. --
