      <p><strong><em>System testing</em>: take the <em>whole system</em> and test it <em>against the system specification</em>.</strong></p>
      <p>System testing is typically done by a testing team (also called a QA team).</p>
      <p><strong>System test cases are based on the specified external behavior of the system.</strong> Sometimes, system tests go beyond the bounds defined in the specification. This is useful when testing that the system fails 'gracefully' having pushed
        beyond its limits.</p>
      <tip-box>
        <p>ðŸ“¦ Suppose the SUT is a browser supposedly capable of handling web pages containing up to 5000 characters. Given below is a test case to test if the SUT fails gracefully if pushed beyond its limits.</p>
        <pre class="hljs"><code>Test case: load a web page that is too big
* Input: load a web page containing more than 5000 characters. 
* Expected behavior: abort the loading of the page and show a meaningful error message. 
</code></pre>
        <p>This test case would fail if the browser attempted to load the large file anyway and crashed.</p>
      </tip-box>
      <p><strong>System testing includes testing against non-functional requirements too.</strong> Here are some examples.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Performance testing</em> â€“ to ensure the system responds quickly.</li>
        <li><em>Load testing</em> (also called <em>stress testing</em> or <em>scalability testing</em>) â€“ to ensure the system can work under heavy load.</li>
        <li><em>Security testing</em> â€“ to test how secure the system is.</li>
        <li><em>Compatibility testing, interoperability testing</em> â€“ to check whether the system can work with other systems.</li>
        <li><em>Usability testing</em> â€“ to test how easy it is to use the system.</li>
        <li><em>Portability testing</em> â€“ to test whether the system works on different platforms.</li>
      </ul>
