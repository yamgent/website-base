      <p><strong><em>Test coverage</em> is a metric used to measure the extent to which testing exercises the code</strong> i.e., how much of the code is 'covered' by the tests.</p>
      <p>Here are some examples of different coverage criteria:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Function/method coverage</strong> : based on functions executed <span class="dimmed">Â e.g., testing executed 90 out of 100 functions</span>.</li>
        <li><strong>Statement coverage</strong> : based on the number of line of code executed <span class="dimmed">Â e.g., testing executed 23k out of 25k LOC</span>.</li>
        <li><strong>Decision/branch coverage</strong> : based on the decision points exercised <span class="dimmed">Â e.g., an <code>if</code> statement evaluated to both <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> with separate test cases during testing is considered 'covered'</span>.</li>
        <li><strong>Condition coverage</strong> : based on the boolean sub-expressions, each evaluated to both true and false with different test cases. Condition coverage is not the same as the decision coverage.</li>
      </ul>
      <tip-box>
        <p>ðŸ“¦ <code>if(x &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 44)</code> is considered one decision point but two conditions.</p>
        <p>For 100% branch or decision coverage, two test cases are required:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>(x &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 44) == true</code> : [e.g. <code>x == 4</code>]</li>
          <li><code>(x &gt; 2 &amp;&amp; x &lt; 44) == false</code> : [e.g. <code>x == 100</code>]</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For 100% condition coverage, three test cases are required</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>(x &gt; 2) == true</code> , <code>(x &lt; 44) == true</code> : [e.g. <code>x == 4</code>]</li>
          <li><code>(x &lt; 44) == false</code> : [e.g. <code>x == 100</code>]</li>
          <li><code>(x &gt; 2) == false</code> : [e.g. <code>x == 0</code>]</li>
        </ul>
      </tip-box>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Path coverage</strong> measures coverage in terms of possible paths through a given part of the code executed. 100% path coverage means all possible paths have been executed. A commonly used notation for path analysis is called the <em>Control Flow Graph (CFG)</em>.</li>
        <li><strong>Entry/exit coverage</strong> measures coverage in terms of possible <em>calls to</em> and <em>exits</em> from the operations in the SUT.</li>

                  <p>Explanation: 100% path coverage implies all possible execution paths through the SUT have been tested. This is essentially â€˜exhaustive testingâ€™. While this is very hard to achieve for a non-trivial SUT, it technically gives us the highest
                    intensity of testing. If all tests pass at 100% path coverage, the SUT code can be considered â€˜bug freeâ€™. However, note that path coverage does not include paths that are missing from the code altogether because the programmer left
                    them out by mistake.</p>
