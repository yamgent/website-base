      <p>Class diagrams can also be used to model objects in the
        <tooltip content="the relevant information that needs to be examined to understand a problem">problem domain</tooltip> (i.e. to model how objects actually interact in the real world, before emulating them in the solution). <strong>Class diagrams are used to model the problem domain are called <em>conceptual class diagrams</em> or <em>OO domain models (OODMs)</em>.</strong></p>
      <tip-box>
        <p>ðŸ“¦ OO domain model of a snakes and ladders game is given below.</p>
        <p>Description: Snakes and ladders game is played by two or more players using a board and a die. The board has 100 squares marked 1 to 100. Each player owns one piece. Players take turns to throw the die and advance their piece by the number of
          squares they earned from the die throw. The board has a number of snakes. If a playerâ€™s piece lands on a square with a snake head, the piece is automatically moved to the square containing the snakeâ€™s tail. Similarly, a piece can automatically
          move from a ladder foot to the ladder top. The player whose piece is the first to reach the 100th square wins.</p>

        <p></p>
        <p>The above OO domain model omits the ladder class for simplicity. It can be included in a similar fashion to the Snake class.</p>
      </tip-box>
      <p><strong>OODMs do not contain solution-specific classes</strong> (i.e. classes that are used in the solution domain but do not exist in the problem domain). For example, a class called DatabaseConnection could appear in a class diagram but not usually
        in an OO domain model because DatabaseConnection is something related to a software solution but not an entity in the problem domain.</p>
      <p><strong>OODMs represents the class <em>structure</em> of the problem domain</strong> and not their behavior, just like class diagrams. To show behavior, use other diagrams such as sequence diagrams.</p>
      <p><strong>OODM notation is similar to class diagram notation but typically omit methods and navigability.</strong></p>

                  <p>Explanation: The diagram shows navigability which is not shown in an OO domain model. Hence, it has to be a class diagram.</p>

                  <p>(a)</p>
                  <p>Explanation: Both are UML diagrams, and use the class diagram notation. While it is true that often a class diagram may have more classes and more details, the main difference is that the OO domain model describes the problem domain
                    while the class diagram describes the solution.</p>
