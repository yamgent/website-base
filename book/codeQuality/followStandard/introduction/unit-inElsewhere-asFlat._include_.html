      <p><strong>One essential way to improve code quality is to follow a consistent style. That is why software engineers follow a strict coding standard (aka <em>style guide</em>).</strong></p>
      <p><strong>The aim of a coding standard is to make the entire code base look like it was written by one person</strong>. A coding standard is usually specific to a programming language and specifies guidelines such as the location of opening and closing
        braces, indentation styles and naming styles (e.g. whether to use Hungarian style, Pascal casing, Camel casing, etc.). It is important that the whole team/company use the same coding standard and that standard is not generally inconsistent with
        typical industry practices. <span class="dimmed">If a company's coding standards is very different from what is used typically in the industry, new recruits will take longer to get used to the company's coding style.</span></p>
