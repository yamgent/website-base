      <p><strong>Design pattern provides a high-level vocabulary to talk about design.</strong></p>
      <tip-box>
        <p>ðŸ“¦ Someone can say 'apply Observer pattern here' instead of having to describe the mechanics of the solution in detail.</p>
      </tip-box>
      <p><strong>Knowing more patterns is a way to become more â€˜experiencedâ€™.</strong> Aim to learn at least the context and the problem of patterns <span class="dimmed">Â so that when you encounter those problems you know where to look for a solution</span>.</p>
      <p><strong>Some patterns are domain-specific</strong> <span class="dimmed">Â e.g. patterns for distributed applications</span>, <strong>some are created in-house</strong> <span class="dimmed">Â e.g. patterns in the company/project</span> and <strong>some can be self-created</strong>        <span class="dimmed">Â e.g. from past experience</span>.</p>
      <p><strong>Be careful not to overuse patterns.</strong> Do not throw patterns at a problem at every opportunity. Patterns come with overhead such as adding more classes or increasing the levels of abstraction. Use them only when they are needed. Before
        applying a pattern, make sure that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>there is substantial improvement in the design, not just superficial.</li>
        <li>the associated tradeoffs are carefully considered. There are times when a design pattern is not appropriate (or an overkill).</li>
      </ul>
