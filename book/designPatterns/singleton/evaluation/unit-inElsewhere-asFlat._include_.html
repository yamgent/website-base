      <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>easy to apply</li>
        <li>effective in achieving its goal with minimal extra work</li>
        <li>provides an easy way to access the singleton object from anywhere in the code base</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The singleton object acts like a global variable that increases coupling across the code base.</li>
        <li>In testing, it is difficult to replace Singleton objects with stubs (static methods cannot be overridden)</li>
        <li>In testing, singleton objects carry data from one test to another even when we want each test to be independent of the others.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Given there are some significant cons, it is recommended that you apply the Singleton pattern when, in addition to requiring only one instance of a class, there is a risk of creating multiple objects by mistake, and creating such multiple objects
        has real negative consequences.</p>
