                    <p>After repeated attempts at solving such problems, better solutions are discovered and refined over time. These solutions are known as design patterns, **a term popularized by the seminal book <em>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</em>                      by the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">&quot;Gang of Four&quot;** (GoF) book written by Eric Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson,and John Vlissides</a></p>

                    <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
                    <p>A certain classes should have no more than just one instance (e.g. the main controller class of the system). These single instances are commonly known as <em>singletons</em>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
                    <p>A normal class can be instantiated multiple times by invoking the constructor.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
                    <p>Make the constructor of the singleton class <code>private</code>, <span class="dimmed"> because a <code>public</code> constructor will allow others to instantiate the class at will</span>. Provide a <code>public</code> class-level
                      method to access the <em>single instance</em>.</p>

                  <div>
                    <p>Here is the typical implementation of how the Singleton pattern is applied to a class:</p>
                    <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Logic</span> </span>{
    <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> Logic theOne = <span class="hljs-keyword">null</span>;

    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-title">Logic</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
        ...
    }

    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">public</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> Logic <span class="hljs-title">getInstance</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{
        <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (theOne == <span class="hljs-keyword">null</span>) {
            theOne = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Logic();
        }
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> theOne;
    }
}
</code></pre>
                    <p>Notes:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The constructor is <code>private</code>, which prevents instantiation from outside the class.</li>
                      <li>The single instance of the singleton class is maintained by a <code>private</code> class-level variable.</li>
                      <li>Access to this object is provided by a <code>public</code> class-level operation <code>getInstance()</code> which instantiates a single copy of the singleton class when it is executed for the first time. Subsequent calls to this
                        operation return the single instance of the class.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If <code>Logic</code> was not a Singleton class, an object is created like this:</p>
                    <pre><code class="hljs java">Logic m = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Logic();
</code></pre>
                    <p>But now, the <code>Logic</code> object needs to be accessed like this:</p>
                    <pre><code class="hljs java">Logic m = Logic.getInstance();
</code></pre>

                      <li>effective in achieving its goal with minimal extra work</li>
                      <li>provides an easy way to access the singleton object from anywhere in the code base</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The singleton object acts like a global variable that increases coupling across the code base.</li>
                      <li>In testing, it is difficult to replace Singleton objects with stubs (static methods cannot be overridden)</li>
                      <li>In testing, singleton objects carry data from one test to another even when we want each test to be independent of the others.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Given there are some significant cons, it is recommended that you apply the Singleton pattern when, in addition to requiring only one instance of a class, there is a risk of creating multiple objects by mistake, and creating such multiple
                      objects has real negative consequences.</p>

                  <div>
                    <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
                    <p>There is a group of similar entities that appears to be ‘occurrences’ (or ‘copies’) of the same thing, sharing lots of common information, but also differing in significant ways.</p>
                    <tip-box>
                      <p>📦 In a library, there can be multiple copies of same book title. Each copy shares common information such as book title, author, ISBN etc. However, there are also significant differences like purchase date and barcode number (assumed
                        to be unique for each copy of the book).</p>
                      <p>Other examples:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Episodes of the same TV series</li>
                        <li>Stock items of the same product model (e.g. TV sets of the same model).</li>
                      </ul>
                    </tip-box>
                    <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
                    <p>Representing the objects mentioned previously as a single class would be problematic because it results in duplication of data which can lead to inconsistencies in data (if some of the duplicates are not updated consistently).</p>
                    <tip-box>
                      <p>📦 Take for example the problem of representing books in a library. Assume that there could be multiple copies of the same title, bearing the same ISBN number, but different serial numbers.</p>
                      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/book.png" height="200">
                      <p></p>
                      <p>The above solution requires common information to be duplicated by all instances. This will not only waste storage space, but also creates a consistency problem. Suppose that after creating several copies of the same title, the librarian
                        realized that the author name was wrongly spelt. To correct this mistake, the system needs to go through every copy of the same title to make the correction. Also, if a new copy of the title is added later on, the librarian (or
                        the system) has to make sure that all information entered is the same as the existing copies to avoid inconsistency.</p>
                    </tip-box>
                    <p><strong>Anti-pattern</strong></p>
                    <tip-box>
                      <p>📦 Refer to the same Library example given above.</p>
                      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/bookFriends.png" height="240">
                      <p></p>
                      <p>The design above segregates the common and unique information into a class hierarchy. Each book title is represented by a separate class with common data (i.e. Name, Author, ISBN) hard-coded in the class itself. This solution is
                        problematic because each book title is represented as a class, resulting in thousands of classes (one for each title). Every time the library buys new books, the source code of the system will have to be updated with new classes.</p>
                    </tip-box>
                    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
                    <p>Let a copy of an entity (e.g. a copy of a book)be represented by two objects instead of one, separating the common and unique information into two classes to avoid duplication.</p>
                    <tip-box>
                      <p>📦 Given below is how the pattern is applied to the Library example:</p>
                      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/bookTitleBookCopy.png" height="260">
                      <p></p>
                      <p>📦 Here's a more generic example:</p>
                      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/beforeAfter.png" height="370">
                      <p></p>
                    </tip-box>
                    <p>The general solution:</p>
                    <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/abstractionOccurrence.png" height="40">
                    <p></p>
                    <p>The <code>&lt;&lt; Abstraction &gt;&gt;</code> class should hold all common information, and the unique information should be kept by the <code>&lt;&lt; Occurrence &gt;&gt;</code> class. Note that ‘Abstraction’ and ‘Occurrence’ are
                      not class names, but roles played by each class. Think of this diagram as a <em>meta-model</em> (i.e. a ‘model of a model’) of the <code>BookTitle-BookCopy</code> class diagram given above.</p>

                      <tooltip content="a French word that means 'front of a building'">Façade</tooltip> class that sits between the component internals and users of the component such that all access to the component happens through the Facade class.</p>

                    <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
                    <p>A system is required to execute a number of commands, each doing a different task. For example, a system might have to support <code>Sort</code>, <code>List</code>, <code>Reset</code> commands.</p>
                    <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
                    <p>It is preferable that some part of the code executes these commands without having to know each command type. <span class="dimmed"> e.g., there can be a <code>CommandQueue</code> object that is responsible for queuing commands and executing them without knowledge of what each command does.</span></p>
                    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
                    <p>The essential element of this pattern is to have a general <code>&lt;&lt; Command &gt;&gt;</code> object that can be passed around, stored, executed, etc without knowing the type of command (i.e. via polymorphism).</p>
                    <p>Let us examine an example application of the pattern first:</p>
                    <tip-box>
                      <p>📦 In the example solution below, the <code>CommandCreator</code> creates <code>List</code>, <code>Sort</code>, and <code>Reset Command</code> objects and adds them to the <code>CommandQueue</code> object. The <code>CommandQueue</code>                        object treats them all as <code>Command</code> objects and performs the execute/undo operation on each of them without knowledge of the specific <code>Command</code> type. When executed, each <code>Command</code> object will access
                        the <code>DataStore</code> object to carry out its task. The <code>Command</code> class can also be an abstract class or an interface.</p>
                      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/command/what/images/commandCreator.png" height="150">
                      <p></p>
                    </tip-box>
                    <p>The general form of the solution is as follows.</p>
                    <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/command/what/images/clientInvoker.png" height="200">
                    <p></p>
                    <p>The <code>&lt;&lt; Client &gt;&gt;</code> creates a <code>&lt;&lt; ConcreteCommand &gt;&gt;</code> object, and passes it to the <code>&lt;&lt; Invoker &gt;&gt;</code>. The <code>&lt;&lt; Invoker &gt;&gt;</code> object treats all commands
                      as a general <code>&lt;&lt; Command &gt;&gt;</code> type. <code>&lt;&lt; Invoker &gt;&gt;</code> issues a request by calling <code>execute()</code> on the command. If a command is undoable, <code>&lt;&lt; ConcreteCommand &gt;&gt;</code>                      will store the state for undoing the command prior to invoking <code>execute()</code>. In addition, the <code>&lt;&lt; ConcreteCommand &gt;&gt;</code> object may have to be linked to any <code>&lt;&lt; Receiver &gt;&gt;</code> of
                      the command (
                      <tooltip content="the object the command will operate on, in case different commands operate on different objects">?</tooltip>) before it is passed to the <code>&lt;&lt; Invoker &gt;&gt;</code>. Note that an application of the command pattern does not have to follow the structure given above.</p>

                    <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
                    <p>Most applications support storage/retrieval of information, displaying of information to the user (often via multiple UIs having different formats), and changing stored information based on external inputs.</p>
                    <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
                    <p>To reduce coupling resulting from the interlinked nature of the features described above.</p>
                    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
                    <p>To decouple data, presentation, and control logic of an application by separating them into three different components: Model, View and Controller.</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li><em>View</em>: Displays data, interacts with the user, and pulls data from the model if necessary.</li>
                      <li><em>Controller</em>: Detects UI events such as mouse clicks, button pushes and takes follow up action. Updates/changes the model/view when necessary.</li>
                      <li><em>Model</em>: Stores and maintains data. Updates views if necessary.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The relationship between the components can be observed in the diagram below. Typically, the UI is the combination of view and controller.</p>

                      <p>📦 Given below is a concrete example of MVC applied to a student management system. In this scenario, the user is retrieving data of one student.</p>

                      <p>In the diagram above, when the user clicks on a button using the UI, the ‘click’ event is caught and handled by the <code>UiController</code>.</p>
                    </tip-box>
                    <p>Note that in a simple UI where there’s only one view, Controller and View can be combined as one class.</p>
                    <p>There are many variations of the MVC model used in different domains. For example, the one used in a desktop GUI could be different from the one used in a Web application.</p>

                      <li>The <code>&lt;&lt; Observable &gt;&gt;</code> maintains a list of <code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;</code> objects. <code>addObserver(Observer)</code> operation adds a new <code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;</code> to the list of <code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;s</code>.</li>
                      <li>Whenever there is a change in the <code>&lt;&lt; Observable &gt;&gt;</code>, the <code>notifyObservers()</code> operation is called that will call the <code>update()</code> operation of all <code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;s</code>                        in the list.</li>

                    <p><strong>Design patterns are usually embedded in a larger design and sometimes applied in combination with other design patterns.</strong></p>
                    <tip-box>
                      <p>📦 Let us look at a case study that shows how design patterns are used in the design of a class structure for a Stock Inventory System (SIS) for a shop. The shop sells appliances, and accessories for the appliances. SIS simply stores
                        information about each item in the store.</p>
                      <p><strong>Use Cases</strong>:</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Create a new item</li>
                        <li>View information about an item</li>
                        <li>Modify information about an item</li>
                        <li>View all available accessories for a given appliance</li>
                        <li>List all items in the store</li>
                      </ul>
                      <p>SIS can be accessed using multiple terminals. Shop assistants use their own terminals to access SIS, while the shop manager’s terminal continuously displays a list of all items in store. In the future, it is expected that suppliers
                        of items use their own applications to connect to SIS to get real-time information about current stock status. User authentication is not required for the current version, but may be required in the future.</p>
                      <p>A step by step explanation of the design is given below. Note that this is one out of many possible designs. Design patterns are also applied where appropriate.</p>
                      <p>A <code>StockItem</code> can be an Appliance or an Accessory.</p>
                      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/stockItem.png" height="100">
                      <p></p>
                      <p>To track that each <code>Accessory</code> is associated with the correct <code>Appliance</code>, consider the following alternative class structures.</p>
                      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/alternativeOne.png" height="120">
                      <p></p>
                      <p>The third one seems more appropriate (the second one is suitable if accessories can have accessories). Next, consider between keeping a list of <code>Appliances</code>, and a list of <code>StockItems</code>. Which is more appropriate?</p>
                      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/alternativeTwo.png" height="100">
                      <p></p>
                      <p>The latter seems more suitable because it can handle both appliances and accessories the same way. Next, an abstraction occurrence pattern is applied to keep track of <code>StockItems</code>.</p>
                      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/alternativeThree.png" height="100">
                      <p></p>
                      <p>Note the inclusion of navigabilities. Here’s a sample object diagram based on the class model created thus far.</p>

                      <p></p>

                    <ul>
                      <li><strong>Creational</strong>: About object creation. They separate the operation of an application from how its objects are created.

                      <li><strong>Structural</strong>: About the composition of objects into larger structures while catering for future extension in structure.
                        <ul>
                          <li>Adapter, Bridge, Composite, Decorator, Façade, Flyweight, Proxy</li>

                      </li>
                      <li><strong>Behavioral</strong>: Defining how objects interact and how responsibility is distributed among them.
                        <ul>
                          <li>Chain of Responsibility, Command, Interpreter, Template Method, Iterator, Mediator, Memento, Observer, State, Strategy, Visitor</li>

                    <p><strong>Design pattern provides a high-level vocabulary to talk about design.</strong></p>
                    <tip-box>
                      <p>📦 Someone can say 'apply Observer pattern here' instead of having to describe the mechanics of the solution in detail.</p>
                    </tip-box>
                    <p><strong>Knowing more patterns is a way to become more ‘experienced’.</strong> Aim to learn at least the context and the problem of patterns <span class="dimmed"> so that when you encounter those problems you know where to look for a solution</span>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Some patterns are domain-specific</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g. patterns for distributed applications</span>, <strong>some are created in-house</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g. patterns in the company/project</span>                      and <strong>some can be self-created</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g. from past experience</span>.</p>
                    <p><strong>Be careful not to overuse patterns.</strong> Do not throw patterns at a problem at every opportunity. Patterns come with overhead such as adding more classes or increasing the levels of abstraction. Use them only when they
                      are needed. Before applying a pattern, make sure that:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>there is substantial improvement in the design, not just superficial.</li>
                      <li>the associated tradeoffs are carefully considered. There are times when a design pattern is not appropriate (or an overkill).</li>
                    </ul>

                  <div>
                    <p>The notion of capturing design ideas as &quot;patterns&quot; is usually attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>. He is a building architect noted for his theories about
                      design. His book <em>Timeless way of building</em> talks about &quot;design patterns&quot; for constructing buildings.</p>
                    <p>Here is a sample pattern from that book:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                      <p>When a room has a window with a view, the window becomes a focal point: people are attracted to the window and want to look through it. The furniture in the room creates a second focal point: everyone is attracted toward whatever
                        point the furniture aims them at (usually the center of the room or a TV). This makes people feel uncomfortable. They want to look out the window, and toward the other focus at the same time. If you rearrange the furniture, so
                        that its focal point becomes the window, then everyone will suddenly notice that the room is much more “comfortable”</p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Apparently, patterns and anti-patterns are found in the field of building architecture. This is because they are general concepts applicable to any domain, not just software design. In software engineering, there are many general types
                      of patterns: Analysis patterns, Design patterns, Testing patterns, Architectural patterns, Project management patterns, and so on.</p>
                    <p>In fact, the abstraction occurrence pattern is more of an analysis pattern than a design pattern, while MVC is more of an architectural pattern.</p>
                    <p>New patterns can be created too. If a common problem needs to be solved frequently that leads to a non-obvious and better solution, it can be formulated as a pattern so that it can be reused by others. However, don’t reinvent the wheel;
                      the pattern might already exist.</p>
