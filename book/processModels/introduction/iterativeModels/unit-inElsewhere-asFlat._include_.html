      <p><strong>The iterative model (sometimes called <em>iterative</em> and <em>incremental</em>) advocates having several <em>iterations</em> of SDLC.</strong> Each of the iterations could potentially go through all the development stages, from requirement
        gathering to testing &amp; deployment. Roughly, it appears to be similar to several cycles of the sequential model.</p>

      <p><strong>In this model, each of the iterations produces a new version of the product.</strong> Feedback on the version can then be fed to the next iteration. Taking the Minesweeper game as an example, the iterative model will deliver a fully playable
        version from the early iterations. However, the first iteration will have primitive functionality, for example, a clumsy text based UI, fixed board size, limited randomization etc. These functionalities will then be improved in later releases.</p>
      <p><strong>The iterative model can take a <em>breadth-first</em> or a <em>depth-first</em> approach to iteration planning.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>breadth-first</strong>: an iteration evolves all major components in parallel.</li>
        <li><strong>depth-first</strong>: an iteration focuses on fleshing out only some components.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Most project use a mixture of breadth-first and depth-first iterations.</strong> Hence, the common phrase ‘an iterative and incremental process’.</p>
