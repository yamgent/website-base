      <p><strong><em>Event-driven</em> style controls the flow of the application by detecting <tooltip content="An event is a notable occurrence that happens inside or outside the software, such as the user clicking a button, a timer running out, minimizing a window, etc.">events</tooltip> from event <em>emitters</em> and communicating those events to interested event <em>consumers</em> .</strong>        This architectural style is often used in GUIs.</p>

        <p>ðŸ“¦ When the â€˜button clickedâ€™ event occurs in a GUI, that event can be transmitted to components that are interested in reacting to that event. Similarly, events detected at a Printer port can be transmitted to components related to operating the
          Printer. The same event can be sent to multiple consumers too.</p>
