      <p><strong>You can use actor generalization in use case diagrams</strong> using a symbol similar to that of UML notation for inheritance.</p>
      <tip-box>
        <p>ðŸ“¦ In this example, actor <code>Blogger</code> can do all the use cases the actor <code>Guest</code> can do, as a result of the actor generalization relationship given in the diagram.</p>
        <img src="/website-base/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/actorGeneralisation.png" height="250"></tip-box>
      <p>ðŸ’¡ Do not over-complicate use case diagrams by trying to include everything possible. A use case diagram is a brief summary of the use cases that is used as a starting point. Details of the use cases can be given in the use case descriptions.</p>
      <p><strong>Some include â€˜Systemâ€™ as an actor to indicate that something is done by the system itself without being initiated by a user or an external system.</strong></p>
      <tip-box>
        <p>ðŸ“¦ The diagram below can be used to indicate that the system generates daily reports at midnight.</p>
        <img src="/website-base/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/systemAsActor.jpg" height="200"></tip-box>
      <p>However, others argue that only use cases providing value to an external user/system should be shown in the use case diagram. For example, they argue that â€˜view daily reportâ€™ should be the use case and <code>generate daily report</code> is not to
        be shown in the use case diagram because it is simply something the system has to do to support the <code>view daily report</code> use case.</p>
      <p>We recommend that you follow the latter view (i.e. not to use System as a user). Limit use cases for modeling behaviors that involve an external actor.</p>
      <p><strong>UML is not very specific about the text contents of a use case.</strong> Hence, there are many styles for writing use cases. For example, the steps can be written as a continuous paragraph. Use cases should be easy to read. Note that there
        is no strict rule about writing all details of all steps or a need to use all the elements of a use case.</p>
      <p><strong>There are some advantages of documenting system requirements as use cases:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Because they use a simple notation and plain English descriptions, they are easy for users to understand and give feedback.</li>
        <li>They decouple user intention from mechanism (note that use cases should not include UI-specific details), allowing the system designers more freedom to optimize how a functionality is provided to a user.</li>
        <li>Identifying all possible extensions encourages us to consider all situations that a software product might face during its operation.</li>
        <li>Separating typical scenarios from special cases encourages us to optimize the typical scenarios.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>One of the main disadvantages of use cases is that they are not good for capturing requirements that does not involve a user interacting with the system.</strong> Hence, they should not be used as the sole means to specify requirements.</p>
