    <p>The following description of the <em>Joys of the Programming Craft</em> was taken from Chapter 1 of the famous book
      <trigger for="modal:mmm" trigger="click"><em>The Mythical Man-Month</em>, by Frederick P. Brooks</trigger>.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as his reward?</strong></p>
      <p>First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own design. I think this delight must be an image of God's delight in making things, a delight shown in
        the distinctness and newness of each leaf and each snowflake.</p>
      <p>Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep within, we want others to use our work and to find it helpful. In this respect the programming system is not essentially different from the child's first clay pencil holder
        &quot;for Daddy's office.&quot;</p>
      <p>Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning. The programmed computer has all the
        fascination of the pinball machine or the jukebox mechanism, carried to the ultimate.</p>
      <p>Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task. In one way or another the problem is ever new, and its solver learns something: sometimes practical, sometimes theoretical, and sometimes both.</p>
      <p>Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by the exertion of the imagination. Few
        media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures....</p>
      <p>Yet the program construct, unlike the poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures, produces sounds, moves arms. The magic of myth and
        legend has come true in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.</p>
      <p>Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built deep within us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p><strong>Not all is delight, however, and knowing the inherent woes makes it easier to bear them when they appear.</strong></p>
      <p>First, one must perform perfectly. The computer resembles the magic of legend in this respect, too. If one character, one pause, of the incantation is not strictly in proper form, the magic doesn't work. Human beings are not accustomed to being
        perfect, and few areas of human activity demand it. Adjusting to the requirement for perfection is, I think, the most difficult part of learning to program.</p>
      <p>Next, other people set one's objectives, provide one's resources, and furnish one's information. One rarely controls the circumstances of his work, or even its goal. In management terms, one's authority is not sufficient for his responsibility.
        It seems that in all fields, however, the jobs where things get done never have formal authority commensurate with responsibility. In practice, actual (as opposed to formal) authority is acquired from the very momentum of accomplishment.</p>
      <p>The dependence upon others has a particular case that is especially painful for the system programmer. He depends upon other people's programs. These are often maldesigned, poorly implemented, incompletely delivered (no source code or test cases),
        and poorly documented. So he must spend hours studying and fixing things that in an ideal world would be complete, available, and usable.</p>
      <p>The next woe is that designing grand concepts is fun; finding nitty little bugs is just work. With any creative activity come dreary hours of tedious, painstaking labor, and programming is no exception.</p>
      <p>Next, one finds that debugging has a linear convergence, or worse, where one somehow expects a quadratic sort of approach to the end. So testing drags on and on, the last difficult bugs taking more time to find than the first.</p>
      <p>The last woe, and sometimes the last straw, is that the product over which one has labored so long appears to be obsolete upon (or before) completion. Already colleagues and competitors are in hot pursuit of new and better ideas. Already the displacement
        of one's thought-child is not only conceived, but scheduled.</p>
      <p>This always seems worse than it really is. The new and better product is generally not available when one completes his own; it is only talked about. It, too, will require months of development. The real tiger is never a match for the paper one,
        unless actual use is wanted. Then the virtues of reality have a satisfaction all their own.</p>
      <p>Of course the technological base on which one builds is always advancing. As soon as one freezes a design, it becomes obsolete in terms of its concepts. But implementation of real products demands phasing and quantizing. The obsolescence of an implementation
        must be measured against other existing implementations, not against unrealized concepts. The challenge and the mission are to find real solutions to real problems on actual schedules with available resources.</p>
      <p>This then is programming, both a tar pit in which many efforts have floundered and a creative activity with joys and woes all its own. For many, the joys far outweigh the woes....</p>

    <p><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a <em>programming paradigm</em>.</strong> A programming paradigm guides programmers to analyze programming problems, and structure programming solutions, in a specific way.</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Programming languages have traditionally divided the world into two parts—data and operations on data. Data is static and immutable, except as the operations may change it. The procedures and functions that operate on data have no lasting state
        of their own; they’re useful only in their ability to affect data.</p>
      <p>This division is, of course, grounded in the way computers work, so it’s not one that you can easily ignore or push aside. Like the equally pervasive distinctions between matter and energy and between nouns and verbs, it forms the background against
        which we work. At some point, all programmers—even object-oriented programmers—must lay out the data structures that their programs will use and define the functions that will act on the data.</p>
      <p>With a procedural programming language like C, that’s about all there is to it. The language may offer various kinds of support for organizing data and functions, but it won’t divide the world any differently. Functions and data structures are the
        basic elements of design.</p>
      <p>Object-oriented programming doesn’t so much dispute this view of the world as restructure it at a higher level. It groups operations and data into modular units called objects and lets you combine objects into structured networks to form a complete
        program. In an object-oriented programming language, objects and object interactions are the basic elements of design.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>Every object has both state (data) and behavior (operations on data). In that, they’re not much different from ordinary physical objects. It’s easy to see how a mechanical device, such as a pocket watch or a piano, embodies both state and behavior.
        But almost anything that’s designed to do a job does, too. Even simple things with no moving parts such as an ordinary bottle combine state (how full the bottle is, whether or not it’s open, how warm its contents are) with behavior (the ability
        to dispense its contents at various flow rates, to be opened or closed, to withstand high or low temperatures).</p>
      <p>It’s this resemblance to real things that gives objects much of their power and appeal. They can not only model components of real systems, but equally as well fulfill assigned roles as components in software systems.</p>

    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Object Oriented Programming (OOP) views the world as <em>a network of interacting objects</em>.</strong></p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 A real world scenario viewed as a network of interacting objects:</p>
      <p>You are asked to find out the average age of a group of people Adam, Beth, Charlie, and Daisy. You take a piece of paper and pen, go to each person, ask for their age, and note it down. After collecting the age of all four, you enter it into a calculator
        to find the total. And then, use the same calculator to divide the total by four, to get the average age. This can be viewed as the objects <code>You</code>, <code>Pen</code>, <code>Paper</code>, <code>Calculator</code>, <code>Adam</code>, <code>Beth</code>,
        <code>Charlie</code>, and <code>Daisy</code> interacting to accomplish to achieve the end result of calculating the average age of the four persons. These objects can be considered as connected in a certain network of certain structure.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>OOP solutions try to create a similar object network inside the computer’s memory</strong> – a sort of a virtual simulation of the corresponding real world scenario – <strong>so that a similar result can be achieved programmatically.</strong></p>

    <p><strong>OOP does not demand that the virtual world object network follow the real world <em>exactly</em>.</strong></p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Our previous example can be tweaked a bit as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Use an object called <code>Main</code> to represent your role in the scenario.</li>
        <li>As there is no physical writing involved, we can replace the <code>Pen</code> and <code>Paper</code> with an object called <code>AgeList</code> that is able to keep a list of ages.</li>
      </ul>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>Every object has both state (data) and behavior (operations on data).</strong></p>

      <p>📦 The interface and implementation of some real-world objects in our example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Calculator: the buttons and the display are part of the interface; circuits are part of the implementation.</li>
        <li>Adam: In the context of our 'calculate average age' example, the interface of Adam consists of requests that adam will respond to, e.g. &quot;Give age to the nearest year, as at Jan 1st of this year&quot; &quot;State your name&quot;; the implementation
          includes the mental calculation Adam uses to calculate the age which is not visible to other objects.</li>

    <p><strong>Objects interact by sending messages.</strong></p>
    <p>Both real world and virtual world object interactions can be viewed as objects sending message to each other. The message can result in the sender object receiving a response and/or the receiving object’s state being changed. Furthermore, the result
      can vary based on which object received the message, even if the message is identical <span class="dimmed">(see rows 1 and 2 in the example below)</span>.</p>

      <p>When writing an OOP program to calculate the average age of Adam, Beth, Charlie, and Daisy, instructions for creating objects <code>Adam</code>, <code>Beth</code>, <code>Charlie</code>, and <code>Daisy</code> will be very similar because they are
        all of the same kind : they all represent ‘persons’ with the same interface, the same kind of data (i.e. <code>name</code>, <code>DoB</code>, etc.), and the same kind of behavior (i.e. <code>getAge(Date)</code>, <code>getName()</code>, etc.).
        Therefore, we can have a class called <code>Person</code> containing instructions on how to create <code>Person</code> objects and use that class to instantiate objects <code>Adam</code>, <code>Beth</code>, <code>Charlie</code>, and <code>Daisy</code>.
        Similarly, we need classes <code>AgeList</code>, <code>Calculator</code>, and <code>Main</code> classes to instantiate one each of <code>AgeList</code>, <code>Calculator</code>, and <code>Main</code> objects.</p>
    </tip-box>

    <p>Let us use the UML notation to illustrate classes and objects under discussion.</p>

      <p>📦 All <code>Person</code> objects have the <code>Name</code> attribute but the value of that attribute varies between <code>Person</code> objects.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p>However, some attributes are not suitable to be maintained by individual objects. Instead, they should be maintained centrally, shared by all objects of the class.

    <p>Similarly, when a normal method is being called, a message is being sent to the receiving object and the result may depend on the receiving object.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Sending the <code>getName()</code> message to <code>Adam</code> object results in the response <code>&quot;Adam&quot;</code> while sending the same message to the <code>Beth</code> object gets the response <code>&quot;Beth&quot;</code>.</p>

    <p>However, there can be methods related to a specific class but not suitable for sending message to a specific object of that class. Such <strong>methods that are called using the class instead of a specific instance are called <mark><em>class-level methods</em></mark></strong>.</p>

    <p>Take the example of writing a payroll application for a university to facilitate payroll processing of university staff. Suppose an <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation adjusts the salaries of all staff members. This operation will be executed
      whenever the university initiates a salary adjustment for its staff. However, the adjustment formula is different for different staff categories, say admin and academic. Here is one possible way of designing the classes in the <code>Payroll</code>      system.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Calling <code>adjustSalary()</code> method for each Staff type:</p>
      <img src="/website-base/book/oopDesign/polymorphism/introduction/images/payroll.png" height="150">
      <p></p>
      <p>Here is the implementation of the <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation from the above design.</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Payroll1</span> </span>{
    ArrayList&lt; Admin &gt; admins;

        <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (Admin ad: admins) {
            ad.adjustSalary(byPercent);
        }
        <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (Academic ac: academics) {
            ac.adjustSalary(byPercent);
        }
    }
}

    <p>Note how processing is similar for the two staff types. It is as if the type of staff members is irrelevant to how they are processed inside this operation! If that is the case, can the staff type be &quot;abstracted away&quot; from this method? Here
      is such an implementation of <code>adjustSalary(int)</code>:</p>
    <tip-box>
      <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Payroll2</span> </span>{
    ArrayList&lt; Staff &gt; staff;
    <span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>

    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">void</span> <span class="hljs-title">adjustSalary</span><span class="hljs-params">(<span class="hljs-keyword">int</span> byPercent)</span> </span>{
        <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (Staff s: staff) {
            s.adjustSalary(byPercent);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
      <p>Notice the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Only one data structure <code>ArrayList&lt; Staff &gt;</code>. It contains both <code>Admin</code> and <code>Academic</code> objects but treats them as <code>Staff</code> objects</li>
        <li>Only one loop</li>
        <li>Outcome of the <code>s.adjustSalary(byPercent)</code> method call depends on whether <code>s</code> is an <code>Academic</code> or <code>Admin</code> object</li>
      </ul>
    </tip-box>
    <p>The above code is better in several ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>It is shorter.</li>
      <li>It is simpler.</li>
      <li>It is more flexible (this code will remain the same even if more staff types are added).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This does not mean we are getting rid of the <code>Academic</code> and <code>Admin</code> classes completely and replacing them with a more general class called <code>Staff</code>. Rather, this part of the code “treats” both <code>Admin</code> and
      <code>Academic</code> objects as one type called <code>Staff</code>.</p>
    <p>For example, <code>ArrayList</code> staff contains both <code>Admin</code> and <code>Academic</code> objects although it treats all of them as <code>Staff</code> objects. However, when the <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation of these objects
      is called, the resulting salary adjustment will be different for <code>Admin</code> objects and <code>Academic</code> objects. Therefore, different types of objects are treated as a single general type, but yet each type of object exhibits a different
      kind of behavior. This is called <em>polymorphism</em> (literally, it means “ability to take many forms”). In this example, an object that is perceived as type <code>Staff</code> can be an <code>Admin</code> object or an <code>Academic</code> object.</p>

    <p><strong>Three concepts combine to achieve polymorphism: <em>substitutability, operation overriding, and dynamic binding</em>.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Substitutability:</strong> Because of substitutability, you can write code that expects object of a parent class and yet use that code with objects of child classes. That is how polymorphism is able to <em>treat objects of different types as one type</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Overriding:</strong> To get polymorphic behavior from an operation, the operation in the superclass needs to be overridden in each of the subclasses. That is how overriding allows objects of different sub classes to <em>display different behaviors in response to the same method call</em>.</li>
      <li><strong>Dynamic binding</strong>: Calls to overridden methods are bound to the implementation of the actual object's class dynamically during the runtime. That is how the polymorphic code can call the method of the parent class and yet execute the
        implementation of the child class.</li>

    <p>Overloading is used to indicate that multiple operations do similar things but take different parameters. Overloaded methods have the same method name but different method signatures and possibly different return types.</p>
    <p>Overriding is when a sub-class redefines an operation using the same method name and the same type signature. Overridden methods have the same name, same method signature, and same return type.</p>

                <p>Take the example of writing a payroll application for a university to facilitate payroll processing of university staff. Suppose an <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation adjusts the salaries of all staff members. This operation will
                  be executed whenever the university initiates a salary adjustment for its staff. However, the adjustment formula is different for different staff categories, say admin and academic. Here is one possible way of designing the classes in
                  the <code>Payroll</code> system.</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <p>📦 Calling <code>adjustSalary()</code> method for each Staff type:</p>

                  <p></p>
                  <p>Here is the implementation of the <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation from the above design.</p>
                  <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Payroll1</span> </span>{

    }
}
</code></pre>
                </tip-box>
                <p>Note how processing is similar for the two staff types. It is as if the type of staff members is irrelevant to how they are processed inside this operation! If that is the case, can the staff type be &quot;abstracted away&quot; from this
                  method? Here is such an implementation of <code>adjustSalary(int)</code>:</p>
                <tip-box>
                  <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Payroll2</span> </span>{
    ArrayList&lt; Staff &gt; staff;

        <span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> (Staff s: staff) {
            s.adjustSalary(byPercent);
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
                  <p>Notice the following:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Only one data structure <code>ArrayList&lt; Staff &gt;</code>. It contains both <code>Admin</code> and <code>Academic</code> objects but treats them as <code>Staff</code> objects</li>
                    <li>Only one loop</li>
                    <li>Outcome of the <code>s.adjustSalary(byPercent)</code> method call depends on whether <code>s</code> is an <code>Academic</code> or <code>Admin</code> object</li>
                  </ul>
                </tip-box>
                <p>The above code is better in several ways:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>It is shorter.</li>
                  <li>It is simpler.</li>
                  <li>It is more flexible (this code will remain the same even if more staff types are added).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This does not mean we are getting rid of the <code>Academic</code> and <code>Admin</code> classes completely and replacing them with a more general class called <code>Staff</code>. Rather, this part of the code “treats” both <code>Admin</code>                  and <code>Academic</code> objects as one type called <code>Staff</code>.</p>
                <p>For example, <code>ArrayList</code> staff contains both <code>Admin</code> and <code>Academic</code> objects although it treats all of them as <code>Staff</code> objects. However, when the <code>adjustSalary(int)</code> operation of these
                  objects is called, the resulting salary adjustment will be different for <code>Admin</code> objects and <code>Academic</code> objects. Therefore, different types of objects are treated as a single general type, but yet each type of object
                  exhibits a different kind of behavior. This is called <em>polymorphism</em> (literally, it means “ability to take many forms”). In this example, an object that is perceived as type <code>Staff</code> can be an <code>Admin</code> object
                  or an <code>Academic</code> object.</p>

    <p><strong>A <em>software requirement</em> specifies a need to be fulfilled by the software product.</strong></p>
    <p>A software project may be,</p>
    <ul>
      <li>a <em>brown-field</em> project i.e., develop a product to replace/update an existing software product</li>
      <li>a <em>green-field</em> project i.e., develop a totally new system with no precedent</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In either case, requirements need to be gathered, analyzed, specified, and managed.</p>
    <p><strong>Requirements come from <em>stakeholders</em>.</strong></p>
    <tip-box type="info">
      <div>

    <p>Identifying requirements is often not easy. For example, stakeholders may not be aware of their precise needs, may not know how to communicate their requirements correctly, may not be willing to spend effort in identifying requirements, etc.</p>

  <h4 id="non-functional-requirements-star">Non-Functional Requirements <small><small>⭐️</small></small>

  <div>
    <p>There are two kinds of requirements:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong><em>Functional requirements</em> specify what the system should do.</strong></li>
      <li><strong><em>Non-functional requirements</em> specify the constraints under which system is developed and operated.</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Some examples of non-functional requirement categories:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Data requirements e.g. size,

          <tooltip content="saving data permanenetly">persistency</tooltip> etc.,</li>

        <ul>
          <li>Business/domain rules: e.g. the size of the minefield cannot be smaller than five.</li>
          <li>Constraints: e.g. the system should be backward compatible with data produced by earlier versions of the system; system testers are available only during the last month of the project; the total project cost should not exceed $1.5 million.</li>
          <li>Technical requirements: e.g. the system should work on both 32-bit and 64-bit environments.</li>
          <li>Performance requirements: e.g. the system should respond within two seconds.</li>
          <li>Quality requirements: e.g. the system should be usable by a novice who has never carried out an online purchase.</li>
          <li>Process requirements: e.g. the project is expected to adhere to a schedule that delivers a feature set every one month.</li>
          <li>Notes about project scope: e.g. the product is not required to handle the printing of reports.</li>
          <li>Any other noteworthy points: e.g. the game should not use images deemed offensive to those injured in real mine clearing activities.
          </li>

    <p>We should spend extra effort in digging NFRs out as early as possible because <strong>NFRs are easier to miss</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g., stakeholders tend to think of functional requirements first</span> and sometimes <strong>they are critical to the success of the software.</strong>      <span class="dimmed"> E.g.

  </h4>
  <div>
    <p><strong>Requirements can be prioritized based the importance and urgency</strong>, while keeping in mind the constraints of schedule, budget, staff resources, quality goals, and other constraints.</p>
    <p>A common approach is to group requirements into priority categories. Note that all such scales are subjective, and stakeholders define the meaning of each level in the scale for the project at hand.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 An example scheme for categorizing requirements:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>Essential</code>: The product must have this requirement fulfilled or else it does not get user acceptance</li>
        <li><code>Typical</code>: Most similar systems have this feature although the product can survive without it.</li>
        <li><code>Novel</code>: New features that could differentiate this product from the rest.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>📦 Other schemes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>High</code>, <code>Medium</code>, <code>Low</code></li>
        <li><code>Must-have</code>, <code>Nice-to-have</code>, <code>Unlikely-to-have</code></li>
        <li><code>Level 0</code>, <code>Level 1</code>, <code>Level 2</code>, ...</li>
      </ul>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>Some requirements can be discarded if they are considered ‘out of <em><tooltip content="the extent to which the software features should go">scope</tooltip></em>’.</strong></p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 The requirement given below is for a Calendar application. Stakeholder of the software (e.g. product designers) might decide the following requirement is not in the scope of the software.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>The software records the actual time taken by each task and show the difference between the <em>actual</em> and <em>scheduled</em> time for the task.</p>

      <p>Given their lightweight nature, <strong>user stories are quite handy for recording requirements during early requirements gathering</strong>.</p>
      <tip-box>
        <p>💡 Here are some tips for using user stories for early stages of requirement gathering:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Define the <em>target user</em>:</strong><br> Decide your target user's profile (e.g. a student, office worker, programmer, sales person) and work patterns (e.g. Does he work in groups or alone? Does he share his computer with others?).
            A clear understanding of the target user will help when deciding the importance of a user story. You can even give this user a name. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Target user Jean is a university student studying in a non-IT field. She interacts with a lot of people due to her involvement in university clubs/societies. ...</span></li>
          <li><strong>Define the <em>problem scope</em>:</strong> Decide that exact problem you are going to solve for the target user. <span class="dimmed"> e.g. Help Jean keep track of all her school contacts</span></li>
          <li><strong>Don't be too hasty to discard 'unusual' user stories:</strong><br> Those might make your product unique and stand out from the rest, at least for the target users.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't go into too much details:</strong><br> For example, consider this user story: <code>As a user, I want to see a list of tasks that needs my attention most at the present time, so that I pay attention to them first.</code><br> When
            discussing this user story, don't worry about what tasks should be considered <em>needs my attention most at the present time</em>. Those details can be worked out later.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't be biased by preconceived product ideas:</strong><br> When you are at the stage of identifying user needs, clear your mind of ideas you have about what your end product will look like.</li>
          <li><strong>Don't discuss implementation details or whether you are actually going to implement it:</strong><br> When gathering requirements, your decision is whether the user's need is important enough for you to want to fulfil it. Implementation
            details can be discussed later. If a user story turns out to be too difficult to implement later, you can always omit it from the implementation plan.</li>

  </h4>
  <div>
    <p><strong>You can use actor generalization in use case diagrams</strong> using a symbol similar to that of UML notation for inheritance.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 In this example, actor <code>Blogger</code> can do all the use cases the actor <code>Guest</code> can do, as a result of the actor generalization relationship given in the diagram.</p>
      <img src="/website-base/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/actorGeneralisation.png" height="250"></tip-box>
    <p>💡 Do not over-complicate use case diagrams by trying to include everything possible. A use case diagram is a brief summary of the use cases that is used as a starting point. Details of the use cases can be given in the use case descriptions.</p>
    <p><strong>Some include ‘System’ as an actor to indicate that something is done by the system itself without being initiated by a user or an external system.</strong></p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 The diagram below can be used to indicate that the system generates daily reports at midnight.</p>
      <img src="/website-base/book/specifyingRequirements/useCases/usage/images/systemAsActor.jpg" height="200"></tip-box>
    <p>However, others argue that only use cases providing value to an external user/system should be shown in the use case diagram. For example, they argue that ‘view daily report’ should be the use case and <code>generate daily report</code> is not to
      be shown in the use case diagram because it is simply something the system has to do to support the <code>view daily report</code> use case.</p>
    <p>We recommend that you follow the latter view (i.e. not to use System as a user). Limit use cases for modeling behaviors that involve an external actor.</p>
    <p><strong>UML is not very specific about the text contents of a use case.</strong> Hence, there are many styles for writing use cases. For example, the steps can be written as a continuous paragraph. Use cases should be easy to read. Note that there
      is no strict rule about writing all details of all steps or a need to use all the elements of a use case.</p>
    <p><strong>There are some advantages of documenting system requirements as use cases:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Because they use a simple notation and plain English descriptions, they are easy for users to understand and give feedback.</li>
      <li>They decouple user intention from mechanism (note that use cases should not include UI-specific details), allowing the system designers more freedom to optimize how a functionality is provided to a user.</li>
      <li>Identifying all possible extensions encourages us to consider all situations that a software product might face during its operation.</li>
      <li>Separating typical scenarios from special cases encourages us to optimize the typical scenarios.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>One of the main disadvantages of use cases is that they are not good for capturing requirements that does not involve a user interacting with the system.</strong> Hence, they should not be used as the sole means to specify requirements.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Coupling</em> is a measure of the degree of <em>dependence</em></strong> between components, classes, methods, etc. Low coupling indicates that a component is less dependent on other components. <strong>High coupling (aka <em>tight</em> coupling or <em>strong</em> coupling) is discouraged</strong>      due to the following disadvantages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Maintenance is harder</strong> because a change in one module could cause changes in other modules coupled to it (i.e. a ripple effect).</li>
      <li><strong>Integration is harder</strong> because multiple components coupled with each other have to be integrated at the same time.</li>
      <li><strong>Testing and reuse of the module is harder</strong> due to its dependence on other modules.</li>

      <li><strong>Subclass coupling</strong>: a class inherits from another class. Note that a child class is coupled to the parent class but not the other way around.</li>
      <li><strong>Temporal coupling</strong>: two actions are bundled together just because they happen to occur at the same time <span class="dimmed"> e.g. extracting a contiguous block of code as a method although the code block contains statements unrelated to each other</span></li>

    <p><strong><em>Cohesion</em> is a measure of how strongly-related and focused the various responsibilities of a component are.</strong> A highly-cohesive component keeps related functionalities together while keeping out all other unrelated things.</p>
    <p><strong>Higher cohesion is better.</strong> Disadvantages of low cohesion (aka <em>weak</em> cohesion):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Impedes the understandability of modules as it is difficult to express module functionalities at a higher level.</li>
      <li>Lowers maintainability because a module can be modified due to unrelated causes <span class="dimmed"> (reason: the module contains code unrelated to each other)</span> or many many modules may need to be modified to achieve a small change in behavior
        <span class="dimmed"> (reason: because the code realated to that change is not localized to a single module)</span>.</li>
      <li>Lowers reusability of modules because they do not represent logical units of functionality.</li>

  </div>
  <h4 id="how-star-2">How <small><small>⭐️</small></small>
  </h4>
  <div>
    <p><strong>Cohesion can be present in many forms</strong>. Some examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Code related to a single concept is kept together, e.g. the Student component handles everything related to students.</li>
      <li>Code that is invoked close together in time is kept together, e.g. all code related to initializing the system is kept together.</li>
      <li>Code that manipulates the same data structure is kept together, e.g. the <code>GameArchive</code> component handles everything related to the storage and retrieval of game sessions.</li>
    </ul>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Suppose a Payroll application contains a class that deals with writing data to the database. If the class include some code to show an error dialog to the user if the database is unreachable, that class is not cohesive because it seems to be
        interacting with the user as well as the database.</p>

        <p><strong><em>Model-driven development (MDD)</em>, also called <em>Model-driven engineering</em>, is an approach to software development that strives to exploits models as blueprints.</strong> MDD uses models as primary engineering artifacts when
          developing software. That is, the system is first created in the form of models. After that, the models are converted to code using code-generation techniques (usually, automated or semi-automated, but can even involve manual translation from
          model to code). MDD requires the use of a very expressive modeling notation (graphical or otherwise), often specific to a given problem domain. It also requires sophisticated tools to generate code from models and maintain the link between models
          and the code. One advantage of MDD is that the same model can be used to create software for different platforms and different languages. MDD has a lot of promise, but it is still an emerging technology</p>

    <p>An OO solution is basically a network of objects interacting with each other. Therefore, <strong>it is useful to be able to model how the relevant objects are 'networked' together</strong> inside a software <span class="dimmed"> i.e. how the objects are connect together</span>.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Given below is an illustration of some objects and how they are connected together. <span class="dimmed"> Note: the diagram uses an ad-hoc notation.</span></p>

    <p>However, object structures do not change at random; they change based on a set of rules, as was decided by the designer of that software. Those <strong>rules that object structures need to follow can be illustrated as a <em>class structure</em></strong>      <span class="dimmed"> i.e. a structure that exists among the relevant classes</span>.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Here is a class structure (drawn using an ad-hoc notation) that matches the object structures given in the previous two examples. For example, note how this class structure does not allow any connection between <code>Genre</code> objects and
        <code>Author</code> objects, a rule followed by the two object structures above.</p>

      <p>The analysis process for identifying objects and object classes is recognized as one of the most difficult areas of object-oriented development. <sub>--<a href="http://www.software-engin.com/">Ian Sommerville, in the book <em>Software Engineering</em></a></sub></p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Class diagrams can also be used to model objects in the
      <tooltip content="the relevant information that needs to be examined to understand a problem">problem domain</tooltip> (i.e. to model how objects actually interact in the real world, before emulating them in the solution). <strong>Class diagrams are used to model the problem domain are called <em>conceptual class diagrams</em> or <em>OO domain models (OODMs)</em>.</strong></p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 OO domain model of a snakes and ladders game is given below.</p>
      <p>Description: Snakes and ladders game is played by two or more players using a board and a die. The board has 100 squares marked 1 to 100. Each player owns one piece. Players take turns to throw the die and advance their piece by the number of squares
        they earned from the die throw. The board has a number of snakes. If a player’s piece lands on a square with a snake head, the piece is automatically moved to the square containing the snake’s tail. Similarly, a piece can automatically move from
        a ladder foot to the ladder top. The player whose piece is the first to reach the 100th square wins.</p>
      <img src="/website-base/book/modeling/modelingStructures/objectOrientedDomainModels/images/diagram.png" height="420">
      <p></p>
      <p>The above OO domain model omits the ladder class for simplicity. It can be included in a similar fashion to the Snake class.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>OODMs do not contain solution-specific classes</strong> (i.e. classes that are used in the solution domain but do not exist in the problem domain). For example, a class called DatabaseConnection could appear in a class diagram but not usually
      in an OO domain model because DatabaseConnection is something related to a software solution but not an entity in the problem domain.</p>
    <p><strong>OODMs represents the class <em>structure</em> of the problem domain</strong> and not their behavior, just like class diagrams. To show behavior, use other diagrams such as sequence diagrams.</p>
    <p><strong>OODM notation is similar to class diagram notation but typically omit methods and navigability.</strong></p>

        <li>If the CD tray is already in the process of opening (opened half-way), it continues to open the CD tray.</li>
        <li>If the CD tray is closed and the CD is being played, it stops playing and opens the CD tray.</li>
        <li>If the CD tray is closed and CD is not being played, it simply opens the CD tray.</li>
        <li>If the CD tray is already in the process of closing (closed half-way), it waits until the CD tray is fully closed and opens it immediately afterwards.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>What this means is that the CD player’s response to pushing the “eject CD” button depends on what it was doing at the time of the event. More generally, the CD player’s response to the event received depends on its internal state. Such a behavior
        is called a <em>state-dependent behavior</em>.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p>Often, state-dependent behavior displayed by an object in a system is simple enough that it needs no extra attention; such a behavior can be as simple as a <em>conditional</em> behavior like <code>if x&gt;y, then x=x-y</code>. Occasionally, objects
      may exhibit state-dependent behavior that is complex enough such that it needs to be captured into a separate model. Such state-dependent behavior can be modelled using UML <em>state machine diagrams</em> (SMD for short, sometimes also called ‘state
      charts’, ‘state diagrams’ or ‘state machines’).</p>
    <p>An SMD views the life-cycle of an object as consisting of a finite number of states where each state displays a unique behavior pattern. An SMD captures information such as the states an object can be in, during its lifetime, and how the object responds
      to various events while in each state and how the object transits from one state to another. In contrast to sequence diagrams that capture object behavior one scenario at a time, SMDs capture the object’s behavior over its full life cycle.</p>

    </ul>
    <p>In the above design, <code>TextUi</code> does not access <code>Cell</code> objects directly. Instead, it gets values of type <code>CELL_APPEARANCE</code> from <code>Logic</code> to be displayed as a minefield to the player. Alternatively, each cell

    <p>The above is for the case when Actor <code>Player</code> interacts with the system using a text UI. Additional operations (if any) required for the GUI can be discovered similarly. Suppose <code>Logic</code> supports a <code>reset()</code> operation.

    <tip-box>
      <img src="/website-base/book/modeling/modelingASolution/intermediate/images/logicMinefieldReset.png" height="100"></tip-box>
    <p>Our current model assumes that the <code>Minefield</code> object has enough information (i.e. H, W, and mine locations) to create itself.</p>

      <p></p>

      <img src="/website-base/book/modeling/modelingASolution/intermediate/images/logicConfigGenerator.png" height="170">

    <ol>
      <li><code>Minefield</code> class knows the state of the game at any time. <code>Logic</code> class retrieves it from the <code>Minefield</code> class as and when required.</li>
      <li><code>Logic</code> class maintains the state of the game at all times.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here’s the SD for option 1.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <img src="/website-base/book/modeling/modelingASolution/intermediate/images/logicMinefieldGetGameState.png" height="180"></tip-box>

    <p>It is now time to explore what happens inside the <code>Minefield</code> constructor? One way is to design it as follows.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <img src="/website-base/book/modeling/modelingASolution/intermediate/images/minefieldCellAlt.png" height="200"></tip-box>
    <p>Now let us assume that <code>Minesweeper</code> supports a ‘timing’ feature.</p>

    <tip-box>
      <p>💡 When designing components, it is not necessary to draw elaborate UML diagrams capturing all details of the design. They can be done as rough sketches. For example, draw sequence diagrams only when you are not sure which operations are required
        by each class, or when you want to verify that your class structure can indeed support the required operations.</p>

      It should be a simple and technically viable structure that is well-understood and agreed-upon by everyone in the development team, and it forms the basis for the implementation.</p>

  <div>
    <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
    <p>A certain classes should have no more than just one instance (e.g. the main controller class of the system). These single instances are commonly known as <em>singletons</em>.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
    <p>A normal class can be instantiated multiple times by invoking the constructor.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
    <p>Make the constructor of the singleton class <code>private</code>, <span class="dimmed"> because a <code>public</code> constructor will allow others to instantiate the class at will</span>. Provide a <code>public</code> class-level method to access
      the <em>single instance</em>.</p>

    <span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">static</span> Logic theOne = <span class="hljs-keyword">null</span>;

    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">private</span> <span class="hljs-title">Logic</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span> </span>{

        }
        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> theOne;
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p>Notes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The constructor is <code>private</code>, which prevents instantiation from outside the class.</li>
      <li>The single instance of the singleton class is maintained by a <code>private</code> class-level variable.</li>
      <li>Access to this object is provided by a <code>public</code> class-level operation <code>getInstance()</code> which instantiates a single copy of the singleton class when it is executed for the first time. Subsequent calls to this operation return
        the single instance of the class.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If <code>Logic</code> was not a Singleton class, an object is created like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="hljs java">Logic m = <span class="hljs-keyword">new</span> Logic();
</code></pre>
    <p>But now, the <code>Logic</code> object needs to be accessed like this:</p>
    <pre><code class="hljs java">Logic m = Logic.getInstance();
</code></pre>

    <ul>
      <li>easy to apply</li>
      <li>effective in achieving its goal with minimal extra work</li>
      <li>provides an easy way to access the singleton object from anywhere in the code base</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The singleton object acts like a global variable that increases coupling across the code base.</li>
      <li>In testing, it is difficult to replace Singleton objects with stubs (static methods cannot be overridden)</li>
      <li>In testing, singleton objects carry data from one test to another even when we want each test to be independent of the others.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Given there are some significant cons, it is recommended that you apply the Singleton pattern when, in addition to requiring only one instance of a class, there is a risk of creating multiple objects by mistake, and creating such multiple objects
      has real negative consequences.</p>

    <h2 id="abstraction-occurrence-pattern">Abstraction Occurrence Pattern</h2>
  </div>
  <h4 id="what-star-20">What <small><small>⭐️</small></small>
  </h4>
  <div>
    <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
    <p>There is a group of similar entities that appears to be ‘occurrences’ (or ‘copies’) of the same thing, sharing lots of common information, but also differing in significant ways.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 In a library, there can be multiple copies of same book title. Each copy shares common information such as book title, author, ISBN etc. However, there are also significant differences like purchase date and barcode number (assumed to be unique
        for each copy of the book).</p>
      <p>Other examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Episodes of the same TV series</li>
        <li>Stock items of the same product model (e.g. TV sets of the same model).</li>
      </ul>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
    <p>Representing the objects mentioned previously as a single class would be problematic because it results in duplication of data which can lead to inconsistencies in data (if some of the duplicates are not updated consistently).</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Take for example the problem of representing books in a library. Assume that there could be multiple copies of the same title, bearing the same ISBN number, but different serial numbers.</p>
      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/book.png" height="200">
      <p></p>
      <p>The above solution requires common information to be duplicated by all instances. This will not only waste storage space, but also creates a consistency problem. Suppose that after creating several copies of the same title, the librarian realized
        that the author name was wrongly spelt. To correct this mistake, the system needs to go through every copy of the same title to make the correction. Also, if a new copy of the title is added later on, the librarian (or the system) has to make
        sure that all information entered is the same as the existing copies to avoid inconsistency.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>Anti-pattern</strong></p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Refer to the same Library example given above.</p>
      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/bookFriends.png" height="240">
      <p></p>
      <p>The design above segregates the common and unique information into a class hierarchy. Each book title is represented by a separate class with common data (i.e. Name, Author, ISBN) hard-coded in the class itself. This solution is problematic because
        each book title is represented as a class, resulting in thousands of classes (one for each title). Every time the library buys new books, the source code of the system will have to be updated with new classes.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
    <p>Let a copy of an entity (e.g. a copy of a book)be represented by two objects instead of one, separating the common and unique information into two classes to avoid duplication.</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Given below is how the pattern is applied to the Library example:</p>
      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/bookTitleBookCopy.png" height="260">

      <p></p>
    </tip-box>
    <p>The general solution:</p>
    <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/abstractionOccurrence/what/images/abstractionOccurrence.png" height="40">
    <p></p>
    <p>The <code>&lt;&lt; Abstraction &gt;&gt;</code> class should hold all common information, and the unique information should be kept by the <code>&lt;&lt; Occurrence &gt;&gt;</code> class. Note that ‘Abstraction’ and ‘Occurrence’ are not class names,
      but roles played by each class. Think of this diagram as a <em>meta-model</em> (i.e. a ‘model of a model’) of the <code>BookTitle-BookCopy</code> class diagram given above.</p>

  </h4>
  <div>
    <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
    <p>A system is required to execute a number of commands, each doing a different task. For example, a system might have to support <code>Sort</code>, <code>List</code>, <code>Reset</code> commands.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
    <p>It is preferable that some part of the code executes these commands without having to know each command type. <span class="dimmed"> e.g., there can be a <code>CommandQueue</code> object that is responsible for queuing commands and executing them without knowledge of what each command does.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
    <p>The essential element of this pattern is to have a general <code>&lt;&lt; Command &gt;&gt;</code> object that can be passed around, stored, executed, etc without knowing the type of command (i.e. via polymorphism).</p>
    <p>Let us examine an example application of the pattern first:</p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 In the example solution below, the <code>CommandCreator</code> creates <code>List</code>, <code>Sort</code>, and <code>Reset Command</code> objects and adds them to the <code>CommandQueue</code> object. The <code>CommandQueue</code> object treats
        them all as <code>Command</code> objects and performs the execute/undo operation on each of them without knowledge of the specific <code>Command</code> type. When executed, each <code>Command</code> object will access the <code>DataStore</code>        object to carry out its task. The <code>Command</code> class can also be an abstract class or an interface.</p>
      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/command/what/images/commandCreator.png" height="150">
      <p></p>
    </tip-box>
    <p>The general form of the solution is as follows.</p>
    <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/command/what/images/clientInvoker.png" height="200">
    <p></p>
    <p>The <code>&lt;&lt; Client &gt;&gt;</code> creates a <code>&lt;&lt; ConcreteCommand &gt;&gt;</code> object, and passes it to the <code>&lt;&lt; Invoker &gt;&gt;</code>. The <code>&lt;&lt; Invoker &gt;&gt;</code> object treats all commands as a general
      <code>&lt;&lt; Command &gt;&gt;</code> type. <code>&lt;&lt; Invoker &gt;&gt;</code> issues a request by calling <code>execute()</code> on the command. If a command is undoable, <code>&lt;&lt; ConcreteCommand &gt;&gt;</code> will store the state
      for undoing the command prior to invoking <code>execute()</code>. In addition, the <code>&lt;&lt; ConcreteCommand &gt;&gt;</code> object may have to be linked to any <code>&lt;&lt; Receiver &gt;&gt;</code> of the command (
      <tooltip content="the object the command will operate on, in case different commands operate on different objects">?</tooltip>) before it is passed to the <code>&lt;&lt; Invoker &gt;&gt;</code>. Note that an application of the command pattern does not have to follow the structure given above.</p>

    <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
    <p>Most applications support storage/retrieval of information, displaying of information to the user (often via multiple UIs having different formats), and changing stored information based on external inputs.</p>
    <p><strong>Problem</strong></p>
    <p>To reduce coupling resulting from the interlinked nature of the features described above.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
    <p>To decouple data, presentation, and control logic of an application by separating them into three different components: Model, View and Controller.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><em>View</em>: Displays data, interacts with the user, and pulls data from the model if necessary.</li>
      <li><em>Controller</em>: Detects UI events such as mouse clicks, button pushes and takes follow up action. Updates/changes the model/view when necessary.</li>
      <li><em>Model</em>: Stores and maintains data. Updates views if necessary.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The relationship between the components can be observed in the diagram below. Typically, the UI is the combination of view and controller.</p>
    <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/modelViewController/what/images/classDiagram.png" width="400">

      <p>In the diagram above, when the user clicks on a button using the UI, the ‘click’ event is caught and handled by the <code>UiController</code>.</p>

    <p>Note that in a simple UI where there’s only one view, Controller and View can be combined as one class.</p>
    <p>There are many variations of the MVC model used in different domains. For example, the one used in a desktop GUI could be different from the one used in a Web application.</p>

      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/observer/what/images/sequenceDiagram.png" height="330">
      <p></p>
      <p>Now, assume the system has two additional views used in parallel by different users:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>StudentListUi</code>: that accesses a list of students and</li>

      <p>However, the <code>StudentList</code> object has no knowledge about <code>StudentListUi</code> and <code>StudentStatsUi</code> (note the direction of the navigability) and has no way to inform those objects. This is an example of the type of problem
        addressed by the Observer pattern.</p>
    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>Context</strong></p>
    <p>An object (possibly, more than one) is interested to get notified when a change happens to another object. That is, some objects want to ‘observe’ another object.</p>

      </ol>
      <pre><code class="hljs java">studentList.addUi(listUi);
studentList.addUi(statusUi);
</code></pre>
      <p>Within the <code>addUi</code> operation of <code>StudentList</code>, all Observer objects subscribers are added to an internal data structure called <code>observerList</code>.</p>

      <p>As such, whenever the data in <code>StudentList</code> changes (e.g. when a new student is added to the <code>StudentList</code>), all interested observers are updated by calling the <code>notifyUIs</code> operation.</p>
      <pre><code class="hljs java"><span class="hljs-comment">//StudentList class</span>

    <p>Here is the generic description of the observer pattern:</p>
    <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/observer/what/images/observableInterfaceDiagram.png" height="100">
    <p></p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;</code> is an interface: any class that implements it can observe an <code>&lt;&lt; Observable &gt;&gt;</code>. Any number of <code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;</code> objects can observe (i.e. listen to changes of)
        the <code>&lt;&lt; Observable &gt;&gt;</code> object.</li>
      <li>The <code>&lt;&lt; Observable &gt;&gt;</code> maintains a list of <code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;</code> objects. <code>addObserver(Observer)</code> operation adds a new <code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;</code> to the list of <code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;s</code>.</li>
      <li>Whenever there is a change in the <code>&lt;&lt; Observable &gt;&gt;</code>, the <code>notifyObservers()</code> operation is called that will call the <code>update()</code> operation of all <code>&lt;&lt; Observer &gt;&gt;s</code> in the list.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In a GUI application, how is the Controller notified when the “save” button is clicked? UI frameworks such as JavaFX has inbuilt support for the Observer pattern.</p>

  <div>
    <p><strong>Design patterns are usually embedded in a larger design and sometimes applied in combination with other design patterns.</strong></p>
    <tip-box>
      <p>📦 Let us look at a case study that shows how design patterns are used in the design of a class structure for a Stock Inventory System (SIS) for a shop. The shop sells appliances, and accessories for the appliances. SIS simply stores information
        about each item in the store.</p>
      <p><strong>Use Cases</strong>:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Create a new item</li>
        <li>View information about an item</li>
        <li>Modify information about an item</li>
        <li>View all available accessories for a given appliance</li>
        <li>List all items in the store</li>
      </ul>
      <p>SIS can be accessed using multiple terminals. Shop assistants use their own terminals to access SIS, while the shop manager’s terminal continuously displays a list of all items in store. In the future, it is expected that suppliers of items use
        their own applications to connect to SIS to get real-time information about current stock status. User authentication is not required for the current version, but may be required in the future.</p>
      <p>A step by step explanation of the design is given below. Note that this is one out of many possible designs. Design patterns are also applied where appropriate.</p>
      <p>A <code>StockItem</code> can be an Appliance or an Accessory.</p>
      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/stockItem.png" height="100">
      <p></p>
      <p>To track that each <code>Accessory</code> is associated with the correct <code>Appliance</code>, consider the following alternative class structures.</p>
      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/alternativeOne.png" height="120">
      <p></p>
      <p>The third one seems more appropriate (the second one is suitable if accessories can have accessories). Next, consider between keeping a list of <code>Appliances</code>, and a list of <code>StockItems</code>. Which is more appropriate?</p>
      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/alternativeTwo.png" height="100">
      <p></p>
      <p>The latter seems more suitable because it can handle both appliances and accessories the same way. Next, an abstraction occurrence pattern is applied to keep track of <code>StockItems</code>.</p>
      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/alternativeThree.png" height="100">
      <p></p>
      <p>Note the inclusion of navigabilities. Here’s a sample object diagram based on the class model created thus far.</p>
      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/stockItemListObjectDiagram.png" height="150">
      <p></p>
      <p>Next, apply the façade pattern to shield the SIS internals from the UI.</p>
      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/withFacade.png" height="200">
      <p></p>
      <p>As UI consists of multiple views, the MVC pattern is applied here.</p>
      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/withMVC.png" height="270">
      <p></p>
      <p>Some views need to be updated when the data change; apply the Observer pattern here.</p>
      <img src="/website-base/book/designPatterns/more/combiningDesignPatterns/images/withObserver.png" height="270">
      <p></p>
      <p>In addition, the Singleton pattern can be applied to the façade class.</p>

    </tip-box>
    <p><strong>Knowing more patterns is a way to become more ‘experienced’.</strong> Aim to learn at least the context and the problem of patterns <span class="dimmed"> so that when you encounter those problems you know where to look for a solution</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Some patterns are domain-specific</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g. patterns for distributed applications</span>, <strong>some are created in-house</strong> <span class="dimmed"> e.g. patterns in the company/project</span> and <strong>some can be self-created</strong>      <span class="dimmed"> e.g. from past experience</span>.</p>
    <p><strong>Be careful not to overuse patterns.</strong> Do not throw patterns at a problem at every opportunity. Patterns come with overhead such as adding more classes or increasing the levels of abstraction. Use them only when they are needed. Before
      applying a pattern, make sure that:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>there is substantial improvement in the design, not just superficial.</li>
      <li>the associated tradeoffs are carefully considered. There are times when a design pattern is not appropriate (or an overkill).</li>

  <div>
    <p>The notion of capturing design ideas as &quot;patterns&quot; is usually attributed to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander">Christopher Alexander</a>. He is a building architect noted for his theories about design. His book
      <em>Timeless way of building</em> talks about &quot;design patterns&quot; for constructing buildings.</p>
    <p>Here is a sample pattern from that book:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>When a room has a window with a view, the window becomes a focal point: people are attracted to the window and want to look through it. The furniture in the room creates a second focal point: everyone is attracted toward whatever point the furniture
        aims them at (usually the center of the room or a TV). This makes people feel uncomfortable. They want to look out the window, and toward the other focus at the same time. If you rearrange the furniture, so that its focal point becomes the window,
        then everyone will suddenly notice that the room is much more “comfortable”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Apparently, patterns and anti-patterns are found in the field of building architecture. This is because they are general concepts applicable to any domain, not just software design. In software engineering, there are many general types of patterns:
      Analysis patterns, Design patterns, Testing patterns, Architectural patterns, Project management patterns, and so on.</p>
    <p>In fact, the abstraction occurrence pattern is more of an analysis pattern than a design pattern, while MVC is more of an architectural pattern.</p>
    <p>New patterns can be created too. If a common problem needs to be solved frequently that leads to a non-obvious and better solution, it can be formulated as a pattern so that it can be reused by others. However, don’t reinvent the wheel; the pattern
      might already exist.</p>

    <p><strong>Professional software engineers often write code using <em>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)</em>. IDEs support all development-related work within the same tool.</strong></p>
    <p>An IDE generally consists of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A source code editor that includes features such as syntax coloring, auto-completion, easy code navigation, error highlighting, and code-snippet generation.</li>
      <li>A compiler and/or an interpreter (together with other build automation support) that facilitates the compilation/linking/running/deployment of a program.</li>
      <li>A debugger that allows the developer to execute the program one step at a time to observe the run-time behavior in order to locate bugs.</li>
      <li>Other tools that aid various aspects of coding e.g. support for automated testing, drag-and-drop construction of UI components, version management support, simulation of the target runtime platform, and modeling support.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Examples of popular IDEs:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Java: Eclipse, Intellij IDEA, NetBeans</li>
      <li>C#, C++: Visual Studio</li>
      <li>Swift: XCode</li>
      <li>Python: PyCharm</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some Web-based IDEs have appeared in recent times too e.g., Amazon's <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloud9/">Cloud9 IDE</a>.</p>
    <p>Some experienced developers, in particular those with a UNIX background, prefer lightweight yet powerful text editors with scripting capabilities (e.g. <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>) over heavier IDEs.</p>

    <p><strong><em>Debugging</em> is the process of discovering defects in the program.</strong> Here are some approaches to debugging:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>👎 <strong>By inserting temporary print statements</strong>: This is an ad-hoc approach in which print statements are inserted in the program to print information relevant to debugging, such as variable values. e.g. <code>Exiting process() method, x is 5.347</code>.
          This approach is not recommended due to these reasons.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Incurs extra effort when inserting and removing the print statements.</li>
          <li>Unnecessary program modifications increases the risk of introducing errors into the program.</li>
          <li>These print statements, if not promptly removed, may even appear unexpectedly in the production version.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>👎 <strong>By manually tracing through the code</strong>: Otherwise known as ‘eye-balling’, this approach doesn't have the cons of the previous approach, but it too is not recommended (other than as a 'quick try') due to these reasons:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>It is difficult, time consuming, and error-prone technique.</li>
          <li>If you didn't spot the error while writing code, you might not spot the error when reading code too.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>👍 <strong>Using a debugger</strong>: A debugger tool allows you to pause the execution, then step through one statement at a time while examining the internal state if necessary. Most IDEs come with an inbuilt debugger. <strong>This is the recommended approach for debugging</strong>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    </blockquote>
    <p><strong>Among various dimensions of code quality, such as run-time efficiency, security, and robustness, one of the most important is understandability.</strong> This is because in any non-trivial software project, code needs to be read, understood,
      and modified by other developers later on. Even if we do not intend to pass the code to someone else, code quality is still important because we all become 'strangers' to our own code someday.</p>

    <p>Make the code as explicit as possible, even if the language syntax allows them to be implicit. Here are some examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>[<code>Java</code>] Use explicit type conversion instead of implicit type conversion.</li>
      <li>[<code>Java</code>, <code>Python</code>] Use parentheses/braces to show grouping even when they can be skipped.</li>
      <li>[<code>Java</code>, <code>Python</code>] Use
        <trigger trigger="click" for="modal:obviousCode-enums">enumerations</trigger> when a certain variable can take only a small number of finite values. For example, instead of declaring the variable 'state' as an integer and using values 0,1,2 to denote the states 'starting', 'enabled', and 'disabled'

    <p>Lay out the code so that it adheres to the logical structure. The code should read like a story. Just like we use section breaks, chapters and paragraphs to organize a story, use classes, methods, indentation and line spacing in your code to group
      related segments of the code. For example, you can use blank lines to group related statements together. Sometimes, the correctness of your code does not depend on the order in which you perform certain intermediary steps. Nevertheless, this order

  </h4>
  <div>
    <p><strong>Optimizing code prematurely has several drawbacks</strong>:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>We may not know which parts are the real performance bottlenecks</strong>. This is especially the case when the code undergoes transformations (e.g. compiling, minifying, transpiling, etc.) before it becomes an executable. Ideally, you should
        use a profiler tool to identify the actual bottlenecks of the code first, and optimize only those parts.</li>
      <li><strong>Optimizing can complicate the code</strong>, affecting correctness and understandability</li>
      <li><strong>Hand-optimized code can be harder for the compiler to optimize</strong> (the simpler the code, the easier for the compiler to optimize it). In many cases a compiler can do a better job of optimizing the runtime code if you don't get in the
        way by trying to hand-optimize the source code.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A popular saying in the industry is <strong><em>make it work, make it right, make it fast</em></strong> which means in most cases getting the code to perform correctly should take priority over optimizing it. If the code doesn't work correctly, it
      has no value on matter how fast/efficient it it.</p>

      <p>Premature optimization is the root of all evil in programming. <sub>--<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a></sub></p>

    <p>Note that <strong>there are cases where optimizing takes priority over other things</strong> <span class="dimmed">e.g. when writing code for resource-constrained environments</span>. This guideline simply a caution that you should optimize only when

                  <p><strong>Abstraction</strong> is a technique for dealing with complexity. It works by establishing a level of complexity (or an aspect) we are interested in, and suppressing the more complex details below that level (or irrelevant to
                    that aspect).</p>

              <p>Most programs are written to solve complex problems involving large amounts of intricate details. It is impossible to deal with all these details at the same time. The guiding principle of abstraction stipulates that we capture only details
                that are relevant to the current perspective or the task at hand.</p>
              <p><strong>Ignoring lower level data items and thinking in terms of bigger entities is called <em>data abstraction</em>.</strong></p>

                <p>📦 Within a certain software component, we might deal with a <em>user</em> data type, while ignoring the details contained in the user data item such as <em>name</em>, and <em>date of birth</em>. These details have been ‘abstracted away’
                  as they do not affect the task of that software component.</p>

              <p><strong><em>Control abstraction</em> abstracts away details of the actual control flow to focus on tasks at a simplified level.</strong></p>

    <p>The happy path (i.e. the execution path taken when everything goes well) should be clear and prominent in your code. Restructure the code to make the happy path unindented as much as possible. It is the ‘unusual’ cases that should be indented. Someone
      reading the code should not get distracted by alternative paths taken when error conditions happen. One technique that could help in this regard is the use of <a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?GuardClause">guard clauses</a>.</p>

    <p><strong>One essential way to improve code quality is to follow a consistent style. That is why software engineers follow a strict coding standard (aka <em>style guide</em>).</strong></p>
    <p><strong>The aim of a coding standard is to make the entire code base look like it was written by one person</strong>. A coding standard is usually specific to a programming language and specifies guidelines such as the location of opening and closing
      braces, indentation styles and naming styles (e.g. whether to use Hungarian style, Pascal casing, Camel casing, etc.). It is important that the whole team/company use the same coding standard and that standard is not generally inconsistent with

  <div>
    <p>Always include a default branch in <code>case</code> statements.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, use it for the intended default action and not just to execute the last option. If there is no default action, you can use the 'default' branch to detect errors (i.e. if execution reached the <code>default</code> branch, throw an exception).
      This also applies to the final <code>else</code> of an <code>if-else</code> construct. That is, the final <code>else</code> should mean 'everything else', and not the final option. Do not use <code>else</code> when an <code>if</code> condition can
      be explicitly specified, unless there is absolutely no other possibility.</p>

    <p><strong>Minimize global variables</strong>. Global variables may be the most convenient way to pass information around, but they do create implicit links between code segments that use the global variable. Avoid them as much as possible.</p>
    <p><strong>Define variables in the least possible scope</strong>. For example, if the variable is used only within the <code>if</code> block of the conditional statement, it should be declared inside that <code>if</code> block.</p>

      <p><strong>The most powerful technique for minimizing the scope of a local variable is to declare it where it is first used.</strong> <sub>-- <em>Effective Java</em>, by Joshua Bloch</sub></p>
